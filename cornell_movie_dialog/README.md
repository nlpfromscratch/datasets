This is a reduced version of the [Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) by Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil.

The original dataset contains 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters, involving 9,035 characters from 617 movies for a total 304,713 utterances.

This reduced version of the dataset contains only the character tags and utterances from the `movie_lines.txt` file, with one utterance per line, suitable for training generative text models.
