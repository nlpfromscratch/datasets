A Neoprimitive.
Someone who believes
that we've ruined the world
by trying to save it.
Your family,
they were killed brutally.
This is all quite distressing.
You want to kill him, don't you?
Oh, very much so.
You can be
my ally or my enemy.
I assure you,
it's not easy being my enemy.
Anything
going on in your life,
new or out of the ordinary?
Whoa.
Jesus.
I missed you, too.
What are you doing?
Just saying hello.
Shall I review?
I prefer to live face forward.
Ass to the past. Let bygones
be bygones, and all that.
I tried to greet you
on my first day here,
and you cut me dead.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, and then there was
that charming letter
on my desk the next morning.
I still have it somewhere,
if you'd like me
to quote verbatim.
Off the top of my head,
without immediate
recourse to the text:
"If you ever f*cking
speak to me again,
I will scratch your eyes out,
you selfish, conniving bitch."
It was "c*nt," I believe.
Bitch. I'm quite certain.
Well, it seems
like I would've gone
with the alliteration
of "conniving c*nt."
Another missed opportunity.
Yeah, like this one,
if you walk away.
Chance to have a drink,
old times' sake?
I'm married.
Well, belated congratulations.
What's she like?
He.
Oh, Grace.
Say it is not so.
I have two children.
f*ck.
You poor thing.
Was it a stipulation?
You broke my f*cking heart.
♪ I'm a fool to want you ♪
♪ I'm a fool to want you...
One drink,
and then I'm off.
So whatever you want to say,
I suggest you get
straight to it.
I just thought it was time
for an after-action review.
Which makes it sound
like a firefight.
It wasn't?

I saw an AI therapist for a bit.
After things fell apart with us.
And is that
how you presented the matter?
That things just "fell apart"?
It said the allure...
and the fatal flaw...
of our relationship
was that you were
a bad good-girl,
and I was a good bad-girl.
On the surface, you make
a show of being rather bad,
but deep down, you're almost
frighteningly good.
And I'm the opposite.
And did you pay
for that drivel
with actual money?
It helped me.
Quite a bit.
Do you still muck about
with those doll's houses?
Not for years.
The AIT had a theory.
It said it was all about
order and control.
That you came from a place
where you had neither,
and the doll's houses were
a way to compensate.
Miniature worlds in which
you could feel safe.
That sounds like a steaming
pile of horsesh*t.
You have
a better explanation?
You have to admit
it's an eccentric hobby.
Do you ever find it difficult
to understand people?
You know, what they're thinking,
what they're feeling?
Empathy, you mean?
There's something about
taking a tiny figure
and shifting it about.
Arranging how it's sitting.
What it's looking at.
And it made me feel
like I had access
into another being's inner...
inner life.
And that can feel
rather priceless.

No.
Water under the bridge.
Swept out to sea long ago.
What, then?
Tell me about your job.
My job?
Yeah.
What mysteries do you oversee,
down there in your secret burrow
with the big steel door?
You don't want to hear about that.
No, I do.
I do.
...like a giant
petri dish, really.
We can do anything we want here.
Well, we are doing
anything we want.
And it's real?
You're certain of that?
Boggles the mind, doesn't it?
See, we're told
it's like a simulation.
An elaborate...
That's how we're instructed
to explain it.
The data we send down
to you lower-echelon types.
Lower-echelon types?
All right.
And, uh, how many
people have access?
Just my team.
And Dr. Nuland, of course.
As well as the upper tier
security personnel.
So maybe two dozen?
You ready?
We call it the God font.
I can access anything here.
And not just
from the stub, either,
but from the R.I.
in its entirety.
But our data culls...
that's just a grain of sand
on a larger beach.
We're actively altering
conditions in the stub.
We have over
8,000 studies running.
Researching what?
It would be difficult to name
a field without a foothold.
Botany, meteorology,
zoology, genetics,
oceanography,
robotics, forestry...
But the truly exciting stuff,
the hush-hush,
saving-the-world sh*t?
That comes from our
Behavioral Mod Department.
They set up a shell
company in the stub
which bid on a contract
with the American military
to install haptic implants
in personnel.
Our tech, more or less,
but on an appropriately
primitive level.
To what end?
Watch. This one's fun.
Let's say we have
a group of elite Marines
at a remote outpost.
They've been told
enemy forces are planning
to use injured animals
to draw them into the open.
So, what would these
highly trained young men do
if a wounded dog were to appear
in front of their position?
Shoot it.
But...
if our implants subtly goosed
the subjects' neural chemistry,
increasing electrical activity
in the anterior insular cortex?
Oh. The, uh, compassion center.
Okay.
Which one?
All of them.
Now, that's where it gets
really interesting.
You see, they all
react differently,
based on their...
their personal histories,
their life experiences.
The mystery of character.
Is he...
Wait for it.
Stop him.
Stop him.
It's already happened, luv.
Long ago.
I mean, you can imagine
the implications.
Implementing
a similar modification
on a societal level.
I mean, say goodbye
to mob violence.
Say goodbye to...
You can't do that.
I mean, they're people.
They're real people.
You see?
So frighteningly good.
Is she planning on implementing
something like that here?
Would you believe me
if I said no?
Has she already?
Again,
would you believe me if I said no?
Good evening.
Wait.
You're from Grains and Legumes?
Yeah, that's right.
Would you mind
explaining
your presence here,
where you assuredly have
no f*cking right to be?
I'm sorry?
You lack clearance
for this floor.
Oh, um, I was just...
You know who I am?
Of course, Dr. Hogart.
Well, then,
perhaps you can explain why
you're addressing an old and
rather dear friend of mine
in such an unacceptably
rude manner?
I am simply doing my job, ma'am.
Her presence on this floor
would seem to require an...
We met upstairs.
But I forgot my jacket.
So I brought her
back down with me.
Under my supervision
and as my guest.
You may file a report
on the matter, if you wish.
But please take care
to sign your name.
So I'll know who to address
my grievance against.
I don't think that will be
necessary, Doctor.
But I will ask that
you not do this again.
Excuse me.
I-I just want to say you have
the most extraordinary eyes.
Seriously.
I...
I'd kill for eyes like that.

Robert O'Connell,
pleasure to make
your acquaintance.
$10 million, Bob.
Twenty-five percent
has already been deposited
into your account.
That's how much
I believe in you.
Name's
not Bob, pal. It's Pete.
Why is it so bloody difficult to
get you people to take my money?
I haven't got the slightest idea
what you're talking about.
I'm talking about
Bob the Butcher O'Connell.
I don't know who that is.
Dublin lad.
Made his name
killing three UDA fighters
on the eve of his 18th birthday.
Racked up quite
an impressive body count
before fleeing the country.
Do you ever count them up
in the night, Bob?
All those poor souls
you've cut free
from their fleshly prisons?
Who the f*ck is this?
Your new employer.
I tried a hammer,
and it didn't work.
So I'm looking for
a better tool.
A scalpel, if you will.
You've been both in your time,
haven't you, Bob?
Seriously, buddy.
You got the wrong number.
Well, I guess I must have
Tommy Giorno's number wrong,
too, then.
Which is a shame, because I was
planning on calling him next.
Maybe tell him
about your daughter.
In that little bungalow of hers.
Baton Rouge, isn't it?
Do I have
your attention now, Bob?
Who do
you want dead?
All right, Flynne.
You ready?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Oh, baby!
Frank's back in the house.
Okay, who's up?
I think it's Tony.
Let's go.
Bring 'em home, Tony.
I didn't get up there.
All right, buddy,
you got this.
You got it. All right.
Back in a sec.
Okay.
Beer, Janet.
And one for my friend.
There you are.
Looking pretty fit
for an old man.
Takes more effort
than it used to,
that's for sure.
Like everything else.
You surprised to see me?
Figured you might pop up.
Not here, though.
This is a bad play, Bobby.
You know how I am.
Always a sucker
for the long odds.
My boys.
Looks like they're all grown up.
The years rush by, don't they?
My daughter,
she's all grown up, too.
I might've let it slide,
Frank, you know,
for old time's sake,
if you'd left her out of it.
The way the guy laid it out...
Who?
I don't know. Voice on the phone.
Some Brit.
He said it was you or me.
Girls, go freshen up.
I ain't proud
of myself, Bobby.
I'm f*cking ashamed
is what I am.
Mr. O'Connell?
Holy sh*t.
Yeah, we thought it was you.
That's enough, folks.
Give us a minute, boys.
We've got some things to talk about.
No.
I think we'll walk
Mr. O'Connell to his car.
What do you say, Bob?
I loved you
like a brother, Frank.
Gun, gun, gun!
♪ 'Cause I know we can ♪
♪ Let's make it something
to shout about ♪

Mr. O'Connell.
I know the what.
The why doesn't matter.
The how is what
you're paying me for.
I need a where
and a when to get it done.
Your targets will be here
tomorrow morning
for a medical procedure
that should take
no longer than an hour.
What type of procedure?
A spinal tap.
After which, they'll return
to their residence,
here.
The rest I leave to you, Bob.
For f*ck's sake.
Oh, no.
Could've just stayed
inside, son, you know?
Pretended to be dead.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna get in this car here.
And if I can get it to start
after your little fusillade,
then I'll be gone.
Now, if you can manage
to crawl free before that,
I'll consider us even.
For your father's sake.
How does that sound?
I can't move my legs.
That arm doesn't look
too great, either.
Good luck.
Oh, please.
f*ck.
f*ck! Don't!
What did you do, Jasper?
What?
Did I or did I not
explicitly tell you
not to take any of that money?
I didn't.
So, this-this just
magically f*cking showed up
in your jacket pocket?
Whoa, babe.
My uncle gave it to me.
For what?
Huh?
Did you ask him
what he wanted in exchange?
Of-of course.
I'm not a f*cking idiot.
And?
He doesn't want nothing for it.
It was just...
a gesture of gratitude
for all my years of hard work.
Seriously, babe.
No strings attached.
That's it.
Nothing's for free, Jasper.
Well, I can give it back,
you want.
No, no.
I guess we can use it.
Could've told me last night, though.
I know.
Saved me a panic attack this morning.
I'm sorry.
There's some coffee
left in the pot,
if you want it.
Thanks.
Have a good day.
You're 100% sure about this?
Absolutely.
It's bacterial.
The oddest thing
I've ever encountered.
Little bit like meningitis,
just extremely localized.
In her occipital lobe.
Which is what again?
It's basically
the part of the brain
involved in seeing.
A lumbar puncture will
at least give us some idea
of what kind of bacteria you got
throwing a party in there.
It looks scarier than it is.
All right, you might feel
some pressure here.
Mm-hmm.
It shouldn't hurt at all,
but by all means, feel free
to hold your brother's hand.
I won't judge.
There.
Wasn't so bad, was it?
Just peachy.
Hello?
Ms. Andrews?
This is Derek Thompson of the
Appleview Insurance Company.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm afraid we've had
to cancel your policy.
When is this change effective?
Immediately, I'm afraid.
I'd make other arrangements
as soon as possible.
And with great care.
My husband and I
had hoped to continue our
relationship with Appleview.
I-If we can?
I'm afraid that might
not be possible, ma'am.
There's a chance Appleview
may be closing its doors soon.
For good.
Jesus, Dad.
But I want to say
that we have valued
our relationship with you.
More than you can
possibly know. I...
And we wish you and your husband
health and happiness in all things.
I'm pregnant.
Well... Well,
that's wonderful news, ma'am.
Goodbye.
And good luck.
You all right, sir?
Just a bit of car trouble.
I'll be fine, thanks.
You want me to take a look?
Well, that's awfully kind
of you, young lady.
But, uh,
I've already called it in.
Mechanic should be
along here any minute now.
Who they sending?
Charlie Burr?
I don't believe
they gave me a name.
Yeah, I'll bet it's Charlie.
I could maybe save you whatever
ransom he'll end up charging.
I appreciate it.
But, uh...
I'll take my chances.
This wouldn't be
one of those situations
where you're looking at me
and thinking
I can't fix a car
'cause I'm a woman, would it?
No, ma'am.
I can take one look at you
and guess you'd know
your way around an engine.
I honestly can't tell
if that's a compliment
or an insult.
Oh,
I'd never waste an insult
on a stranger, young lady.
I save them up
for friends and family.
Okay. Well,
good luck to you, sir.
Take care, now.
Let-let me just take
a quick look on the off chance
I can one-up Charlie.
I-I got some history with him,
which I won't bore you sharing,
but sending a little grief
his way would make my morning.
You don't mind, do you?
I'd, uh, actually
just as soon wait.
What happened?
Gravel truck overturned.
Almost like getting hit
by buckshot.
Not a pleasant experience,
I can assure you.
Whoo-whee.
You're having quite a day.
You're telling me.
And just getting started, too.
Okay, I'm gonna give you
a friendly warning here, mister.
If you let Burton Fisher
touch this engine
when you wouldn't let me,
I might have to just go
and shoot you both.
Tell me you didn't run
into this man with that
tired-looking truck of yours,
Billy Ann.
Just trying to be a Good Samaritan here, Burton.
But some folks
can't seem to believe
a woman might know
how to fix a car.
I think the young lady
simply misunderstood me.
I, uh, I apologize
for all the fuss.
I-I didn't mean to
offend anybody or I was, um...
I guess a bit flustered,
to be honest.
Shoot him.
Shoot him now.
Get down!
sh*t.
You okay?
Burton, Burton! sh*t.
f*ck. I'm stuck. f*ck.
You all right? Knife.
f*ck. Burton!
Pretty good with a shotgun, too.
Want to see?
Next one's in the head, old man.
Flynne?
This what you do
to suspects, ain't it?
Break 'em up?
Talk to 'em one-on-one,
get the story straight?
Witnesses, too, Flynne.
Now, what about victims, Tommy?
You, uh, you got any idea
what this is?
I don't know. Hell, I mean,
it looks like it's almost
something from the...
future, you know?
Yeah,
it does, don't it?
Well, he hasn't said a peep.
No ID, no registration, nothing.
But he is wearing a vest.
And?
Makes it feel like he was
expecting a fight, don't it?
Sort of like Burton seems to be.
Driving around, all geared up
like he's still off in Texas.
Weapons, drones,
all ready to go?
If he wanted him dead, Tommy,
you know he would have done it.
But he didn't.
We called you instead.
I know that.
But I can't help thinking...
you know, a dead body
on this bridge?
Y'all got Homeland
Security showing up.
Whereas just some bullets
flying, without a corpse?
Well, that remains
a local matter, now, don't it?
We're not doing
anything wrong, okay?
Promise you.
You know what my first
memory of you is, Flynne?
My very first?
I was in the third grade.
So you must've been in first.
And they had you down at the
principal's office in a rage.
Remember?
'Cause somehow,
you managed to take
all the earthworms
from the science room
and dumped them in the woods.
Couldn't bear to have the fifth
graders dissecting them.
Made quite the impression,
I'll tell you what.
My uncle had a saying,
how people are
a lot like onions.
One skin grows
over another, year by year.
Which would mean
that little girl,
who freed all them worms...
...she's still inside you.
And I can't help but feeling
I ought to protect her if I can.
But I need your help.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Guess you better, uh...
head on home.
Flynne?
Talk to me, sweet pea.
I don't know.
Thousand ways it could have
gone wrong back there.
Can't dwell
on the past, Flynne.
Got to focus on
what's in front of us.
How, Burton?
When they're always
about ten steps ahead of us?
He was posted up
on that bridge waiting for us.
He knew that we'd come by.
Let's just get you home.
Safe and sound.
Then we can talk about it.
No need to censor
yourself around me, Burton.
I know more than you think.
Trips to the future.
Men coming in the night
to attack you.
And you sending Corbell Pickett
a bag full of cash.
Then I guess you can see
how maybe there's a conflict
of interest at play here, Billy Ann?
I think we can agree
we're both interested
in Flynne's well-being.
It's not you
I'm concerned about.
If you're insulting Jasper,
you're insulting me.
And I'd say what just
unfolded ought to buy me
a little trust
and a whole lot of respect.
Jasper would never harm a soul.
Let alone Flynne. Never.
I'm a phone call away.
Thank you.
I didn't say nothing
that wasn't true, Flynne.
Burton, she's a friend
of mine, okay?
And I'd like to think that
she's a friend of yours, too.
Like it or not,
she's involved
in this now, okay?
It's getting real hard
to keep this under wraps.
Billy Ann ain't the problem.
Tommy and his sheriff
badge ain't the solution.
We should have closed
that loop on the bridge.
Yeah, well, you didn't.
Where's Mama?
Mama? Leon?
Oh, no, Burton. The bodies.
sh*t.
I'm just struggling
to wrap my head around this.
Medicine sent from the future.
Just the formula for it.
They sent it
to Pharma Jon to print.
Sent how?
Does it matter, Mama?
It worked.
Do you know why
your cousins grew up in Ohio?
'Cause Uncle Charles
lost their farm to the bank.
My daddy told me
that story enough times
for me to grow impatient, too.
But I also took it to heart.
The idea that the worst thing
a person can do is grow
dependent on some outsider.
All they care about is taking
something from your pocket
and putting it in theirs,
and on a regular basis, too.
But we aren't
paying them anything.
They're the ones paying us.
That's what my Uncle
Charles must've thought,
when that loan money came in.
They're giving me these drugs.
What happens
if I stop taking them?
I don't know.
What happens if you stop
paying Corbell Pickett?
Now I-I'm putting aside
all the traveling
to the future part
'cause I suppose I'll need
to think on that for a while
before I find
a way to accept it.
But the dependency seems
simple enough.
And it makes me
worry for all of us.
Because I-I'm just getting
caught up here,
on all the complicated
ins and outs
of what you got going on.
But if it looks to me
like you don't have
that much power
in your current arrangement,
think how it must look to them.
We need
to talk this through.
Burton, I'm done being
a sitting duck.
We don't even know
if that headset is safe.
And how safe is it here?
Sitting around, just waiting
for someone to come and get us?
Yes?
The polts have hacked
into the Peripheral.
Do you want us to cut the connection?
No.
This is a pleasant surprise.
No, Wilf.
A surprise is when someone
tries to kill you
out of the blue, which is
what just happened to me.
A whole new person.
And he had one of those
sonic punch things,
like the guy
from the Research Institute had.
I didn't...
You were supposed to
let us know if somebody else
was coming to kill us.
Except you can't only
not do that,
but you didn't even know
it happened after the fact.
So much for your
living-in-the-future wisdom
bullsh*t, huh?
Flynne. What happened?
It's a f*cking mess now.
The Sheriff's
Department's involved.
There's gonna be a lot
of complications, Wilf.
Is everyone okay?
I need to ask you something.
The other day
when we went walking
and you linked up with me...
...did you have another motive?
I'm not sure I'm following.
Were you trying to confuse me?
Or...
my emotions, I guess,
with the haptic drift stuff?
Haptic drift?
I-I don't know what that means.
Wilf...
Did you merge with me
so I would start to...
...I don't know,
have feelings for you
that you hadn't
necessarily earned yet?
I'm sorry, Ms. Fisher.
I honestly...
Wilf...
I'm starting to trust you.
Is that a mistake?
No.
No.
How old are you, son?
I'm guessing 28 or so?
I don't read you as ex-military,
for some reason.
You've probably
never left this town.
Lived a nice, quiet life here,
I imagine.
Well, that's over now.
The quiet part, I mean.
Though maybe
the living part, too,
depending on how this plays out.
You believe there are
moments when fate
can go one way or another?
Like a fork in the road?
'Cause you're at one.
Whether you know it or not.
Now, you can take me
back the station.
You can book me,
you can put my prints
in the system, swab my DNA,
and you set a clock ticking.
On me, for certain.
But on you, too.
Because the people
who'll be coming for me, well,
they're not the sort
to leave loose ends untied.
And me talking to you
like this, well...
I'm afraid that
makes you a loose end.
Goddamn it.
Look at your face.
Don't you ever play poker.
You're too transparent.
I can see the curiosity
building up inside you.
"Who the f*ck is this guy?
What's he doing,
coming round here
trying to kill these folks?"
Well, I'll tell you.
Someone said they would
kill my daughter if I didn't.
They also paid me $2.5 million.
First installment
of an eventual ten,
if the job got done right.
Which...
...it didn't, obviously.
Who?
A voice on the phone.
Doesn't matter who.
What matters is
the $2.5 million.
Which is yours...
...if you want it.
What do you say, Deputy, huh?
I say...
f*ck.
I fear
I've made a mistake,
agreeing to bring you here.
I'm questioning
what you might hope
to achieve by going in there.
I want Cherise to know
what it feels like.
To be hunted.
What? You don't think
I can handle her?
Oh, I have no doubt
you can handle her.
It's the afterward
that concerns me.
This isn't fending off
an attacker.
It's being
the assailant yourself.
Which carries
a far heavier weight.
How would you even know?
You're always off in some corner
watching, aren't you?
Did I tell you
how I first met Lev?
When I was 12 years old,
my parents sent me
to boarding school.
We were still crawling out
of the Jackpot at that point.
And there were
some people who didn't like
the way power in
the new world was coalescing.
They saw it as corrupt.
What? Neoprims, you mean?
They attacked the school.
Why? You were just kids.
To send our parents a message.
The Neoprims had me serve them
their food at the refectory.
And they failed to notice
when I grabbed a steak knife
off one of their trays.
I slashed their leader's throat.
Then shot
his four companions dead.
It was self-defense, Wilf.
Even self-defense
can be cold-blooded.
I didn't think of the weight...
...because I never
could have imagined it.
Don't go over there.
Unless you realize
what you might have to do.
And you're at peace with it.
How may I be of assistance?
Has my face been scanned?
Of course.
That's all the assistance
I'm gonna need.
Ma'am, if you don't have an appointment...
...I'm afraid I'll need
to call security.
I think I can handle it
from here. Thank you.
Hmm.
I just assumed you'd be taller.
I can only spare a minute, alas.
So perhaps we ought to get
straight down to business.
How can I be of help?
You mean, besides not
killing me and my family?
Well, exactly, because
that's rather nonnegotiable.
The f*ck did I ever do to you?
Sticky fingers, dear.
You absconded with
some rather vital data.
Just return it,
and all shall be forgiven.
I didn't take sh*t from you.
I played my game and died.
Got sent home. End game.
So Aelita West still has it?
I don't know
who the f*ck has it.
And quite frankly,
I don't give a sh*t.
I just need you to leave me
and my family alone.
You're either lying, or
expendable in your ignorance.
Either way, your death
continues to be
my only viable goal.
Now, what makes you
so certain I won't kill you?
Right here?
I mean,
I'm not that careless, dear.
Now, I'm in
a Peripheral of my own.
Ah, that doesn't mean I can't
deal you an awful lot of pain.
Though I do imagine
you'd pop right out
of that thing
at the first sign of trouble.
And why would you say that?
Now, you see, we got people
like you where I'm from.
Folks with power, money,
love to walk all over
the rest of us.
Not the kind to suffer through
anything close to a real fight.
I've lived through
more extremity
than you could possibly imagine.
It would crush
your tiny little mind.
So please, don't care
to lecture me about pain.
Oh, I don't want to lecture you.
I just want to snap
your f*cking neck.
Do you feel it?
The darkness closing in?
Let it be preparation
for when I kill you,
and it's real.
Ah!
I got a foothold
in your world now.
So next time, I'll be
coming for you instead.
There's been a murder
involving a Peripheral.
Well, I suppose
we best get busy.
How come people here
stay so distant to us?
Do this.
You're telling me
your invisible car's missing?
How hard did you hit
that pretty head of yours?
You almost got killed.
Is there something else
you're not telling me?
Whatever you do,
don't lie to her.
It wasn't an accident,
it was more like an ambush.
No, no, no, no, no.
