Aelita says I'm likely
not to exist in ten years.
What does she mean by that?
The trauma leaves a mark.
When I can't sleep,
I try to solve
the riddle
of your sister and you.
We were only planning
to adopt one.
Well, perhaps in that case we could...
I'm not going without Wolf.
What's it feel like when
you link up with your haptics?
It can kind of feel a lot like
love if you don't know
any better.
Some dumb f*ck said
you might have a job for me?
I've got a carrot,
and I've got a stick.
I'm curious about the stick.
Next one's
in your f*cking ear.
Aye, Wolfy,
oi, into the pot.
Come on.
That's it.
So what you're telling me is
that's it from the borough?
Omar's crew got there first.
You nicked some, didn't you?!
Angus, stop!
You damn liar!
You thief!
Angus, let go!
Stop!
Thief.
Quit mucking about, Angus.
Get on with it.
What're you doing?
I'm being fair.
He ain't pulling his weight.
I'm pulling enough for him.
Then give him your lot.
I don't want it.
Fine. I'll give it to the mouse.
Then what will happen?
Then... he'll ask
for a splash of milk.
Next in line!
What's that?
They're giving away free food.
Give that back!
Dodgy, innit?
I never seen that place before.
You know what, Wolfy?
It's about time
you earn your keep.
Go have a look for us.
He's not doing that.
Kids are getting snatched.
I'm sorry.
Do you need your girlfriend
protecting you?
Good lad.
The city wants
to clear the streets,
and that includes us, too.
Don't be stupid, Wolf.
You see that? You see that?
That's the last time
I'll see you, Wolf.
I'm not getting scooped.
Wolf!
Wolf!
Just one
for everyone!
Aelita!
Wolf!
Aelita!
Wolf!
Aelita!
Wolf!
Aelita!
Wolf!
Aelita!
An implant
and two peripheral CPUs?
This is all
that's left of Aelita?
This is all quite distressing.
I'm half tempted
to just dump these in the river
and have done with it.
Ash and Ossian
should be able to trace
where the Peripherals
were piloted from.
And if they can unlock
Aelita's implant...
Doubtful, given the encryption.
All I'm saying is there are
other avenues for us to pursue.
And rather a few
for others to pursue,
starting with a corpse,
which will be discovered soon,
no doubt, if it hasn't already.
And your DNA,
we must presume,
is scattered rather liberally
all over the place.
I would send a... team
to scrub the site, but
if they were discovered there,
well...
At the very least,
you must gird yourself
for the harsh reality
of Aelita's death.
Why?
Without the immunity boost
of her implant,
how long could she last?
What the f*ck?
Flynne!
We've got company.
What's the word,
Tommy?
Oh, just thought
I should come by.
Say hey.
Saw you and Corbell Pickett
shaking hands.
Down at Jimmy's.
It had me a bit concerned.
All the abandoned vehicles.
That bullet.
All them drones you got up.
So, thought I'd come by
for a visit.
My own clothes, my own truck.
Just to make it clear,
I'm here as a friend.
Not as a deputy.
Appreciate that, Tommy.
Everything you're saying, but,
uh...
you don't have
to worry about us.
What about you, Flynne?
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, we both are.
Well, all right, then.
Said what I had to.
You two, uh, think on it maybe.
And, uh, Burton?
Try to remember...
the part
about me being your friend?
Look like you could use one.
I surely will.
I f*cking hate it,
Burton.
Lying to him like that.
I mean, I...
I can't keep doing it.
There's a dozen
dead bodies out back.
It's easy for Tommy
to say he's our friend,
as long as he doesn't know
about 'em.
But as soon as he does,
he's also gonna remember
he's a cop.
There's no way around that.
Why can't we just tell him what
we're telling everyone else?
You can't really deny that
we need some help right now.
I guess I'm worried
you're not thinking clearly.
What?
You can't be
rational about this.
You f*cking kidding me,
right now? Rational?
Why? 'Cause I'm a woman?
That's not what I'm saying, Flynne.
Not everyone is
as cold-blooded as you
and your f*cking
jarhead friends, all right?
Not everyone wants to be.
You're too tangled up in this.
Tangled up in what?
Have you been going
through my f*cking trash?
It was right there, Flynne.
You need to leave.
Get the f*ck out of my room,
Burton, now.
Go!
Hey!
I know a lot of terrible sh*t
happened to you off in the war.
I get that,
and I f*cking hate it.
But you went
because you chose to.
And you got to see
a whole lot of stuff
before the bad stuff happened,
okay, but I had to stay here.
Okay, it was me who picked up
the pieces after Dad died.
And when Mama got sick
and then when your ass got home.
That was me, Burton!
It was all f*cking me!
And I didn't have nothing,
Burton.
I know it, Flynne.
I had nothing.
I had nothing, just sims
and a stupid f*cking crush.
And I know it's dumb, okay?
I'm not an idiot.
Flynne.
But it mattered to me.
Flynne. Flynne!
It mattered to me because it f*cking helped.
And you have no f*cking
right at all, no right
to come in my room
and say that sh*t to me!
Flynne. Flynne?
Oh, f*ck.
Hey. Hey. Flynne?
Leon!
Wasn't he
a bit lighter?
Thinner around
the shoulders, I mean?
We used
his most recent scan, Doctor,
from seven weeks ago.
Perhaps once we input
gait and posture analysis,
his gestalt impression
will be different.
I assumed you'd already done that.
No, ma'am.
But if you...
Yes. Please.
By all means.
Mm, better.
Speak.
Model X409-27A.
At your service, ma'am.
Have you input anything?
We were told you wanted
a clean system, Doctor.
Voice scan
and sense of self, please.
I'll take care of the rest.
Speak.
It's nice
to see you again,
Dr. Nuland.
The pitch is rather high.
Speak.
Does this fit your recollection?
I'll handle it from here.
Poor Daniel.
No pun intended,
but things did take
a rather sharp turn
for us there, didn't they?
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
This is our most recent model,
if that's any solace.
There's only a few
in service yet.
I suppose one could see it
as a sort of honor.
I'm delighted to hear it, ma'am.
Oh, no, you sound
far too agreeable, though.
Um, adjust, please.
Decreasing amicability.
By what percent?
Try 20.
If that's what you really want.
Lovely.
Now...
what do we have
from your unfortunate encounter
with mortality the other night?
Wilf Netherton.
Adoptive brother to Aelita West.
Also known associate
of Lev Zubov.
There's our Klept connection
at last.
Which would seem
to rather unhappily
complicate the situation.
I defer to your judgment,
of course.
Here and always.
Although in this particular
case, I would tend to disagree.
You want to kill him, don't you?
Oh, very much so, Doctor.
Tell me,
where I can find Lev Zubov now?
Scanning localization data.
Subject geolocated
in Virginia Water.
This is stupid,
Burton.
I feel fine.
You didn't look fine 20 minutes ago.
You still don't.
I thought that we were supposed to stay quiet,
not tell people stuff
they don't really need to know.
You had a f*cking seizure,
Flynne.
Tyra Ansted had a seizure
in tenth grade, remember that?
In the middle of chemistry.
Never happened to her again.
Tyra Ansted wasn't
using a headset
so she could travel to the f*cking future.
It's not time travel.
It's data transfer.
And all she's gonna tell me is
to not wear a f*cking headset.
Then we'll deal with it.
How?
You're not putting on
the headset again if it's
harming you, Flynne, period.
Goddamn it.
Mm.
You okay?
f*cking seriously?
You just got to give me a little
bit of f*cking space, Burton.
Hey, hey.
What?
It's Dee Dee in there.
And?
And she's Tommy's fianc√©e.
Are you cool with that?
Jesus Christ.
I mean, it seems like you got...
Look, remember when you were 12
and you and Conner
hid that f*cking weed
in the attic and I found it?
What happened?
I flushed it down the toilet.
And said?
"Let's never talk about this again."
Uh-huh. This is the first time
I brought it up since then.
Ain't it? How about you try
doing that for me?
Please?
Well, I'll be
honest with you, Flynne,
we have ourselves
a bit of a mystery here.
The way Burton is describing
what happened makes it sound
like a classic
tonic-clonic seizure.
What they used to call
"grand mal."
But if that were the case,
I ought to be seeing
the aftereffect on your EEG.
And I'm not.
This all looks
perfectly healthy.
Also a tonic-clonic is generally
followed by a postictal phase...
deep sleep, confusion, amnesia...
but it sounds like
you just popped up,
more or less, and came on in.
Anything else going on
in your life?
New or out of the ordinary?
She's been playing a new sim.
VR, you mean?
Uh...
it's a little more elaborate
than that.
Sort of a full-body experience.
New sort of headset.
What's it called?
The new tech.
I can check and see
if there have been any studies.
I don't believe
it has a name yet.
Well, where's it from?
Colombian company.
It's kind of a long story,
actually.
Okay.
Well, stop using it.
That seems like a no-brainer.
To use a technical term.
I'll run your blood work,
get you in for a CT scan
at the Hefty Mart.
Sure.
And in the meantime, rest,
fluids, all that good stuff.
Call me if there's
anything unusual.
And by "anything,"
I mean anything.
All right?
Sure thing, Dee Dee.
Thank you.
Oh, and, Burton,
will you do me a favor
and send me the contact info
for your Colombian company?
I wanna call them
about that headset.
Trick or treat!
I think she might've meant all headsets, Flynne.
Jesus.
Yeah, she might've meant
all headsets,
but she sure as hell
didn't say that.
What are you gonna do
about that anyway?
Her asking us what the name
of the company is and all.
Dodge and delay.
My most impressive skill set,
some might argue.
I knew we shouldn't have
told her.
She's got a lot coming at her,
running that clinic.
Which'll do wonders to erode
a person's attention span.
What are you playing?
Nothing actually.
Just watching a...
home movie.
Which one?
One of the old ones.
Mm.
Hey, listen, uh...
I'm sorry.
For what?
You're getting
a f*cking brain scan.
We can start there.
And then we can keep going,
I imagine,
till I run out of things
I need to apologize for.
Yeah, but, Burton,
Mama's seeing again.
Want to apologize for that, too?
Talking about you here, Flynne.
I've been to London, Burton.
Hell, I visited the future.
None of the bad stuff
happening right now...
...none of it can hold a candle
to what it's like to go there.
You have no idea
how magical it is.
So it's fine, okay? Don't worry.
You don't need to say sorry.
I'm not saying
you shouldn't do it.
But if you're gonna do it,
you better have a good argument
for the doing it.
And by "good," I mean not just,
"I want to see what it's like."
But I do want to see
what it's like.
I get that, and I wouldn't
mind seeing myself,
but we can't afford
having you end up on your back,
kicking your heels against the
floor and frothing at the mouth.
Given the unknown contingencies
we've been encountering
in the here and now.
If this sh*t is harming Flynne,
then someone's got to go there
and knock those assholes
back on their f*cking heels.
I mean, they got these
cool things called phones.
I mean in person, Leon.
I think that's
the wrong way to put it,
but I-I get what you're saying.
Physically.
In a body.
Slamming up against theirs,
if need be.
She's scheduled any minute.
Now's the time.
Surprise the f*cking sh*t out of 'em.
I hate to keep saying this
'cause it seems like
you don't want to hear it,
but if you end up WIA,
we're all...
She's got a body
when she goes in there?
A real one?
I'm so sorry.
For?
Disturbing you.
Inexcusable, isn't it?
Interrupting me
whilst I sip my tea?
You have
a strikingly feline manner
slinking about the house, Wilf.
Always slipping
out of rooms when I appear.
I'll confess I always
found it rather unappealing.
Your constant slipping away.
Seemed like
a form of shiftiness,
as if you couldn't be trusted.
But then quite by chance,
Lev and I went slumming it
one night at SHUM.
And we saw you there dancing.
And then I realized what
I'd taken for sneaking about
was actually
just a form of dancing.
A way of skirting free
from any entanglement.
Because that's what you fear,
isn't it?
Someone getting hold of you?
Literally or metaphorically?
Dance with me.
I'm sorry?
Indulge me.
Just for a moment.
And I'll stop tormenting you.
I promise.
‚ô™ You can't read my mind ‚ô™
‚ô™ It's 4:00 a.m.,
I sashay with myself ‚ô™
‚ô™ Couples all surround me ‚ô™
‚ô™ So in love, eyes all aglow ‚ô™
‚ô™ Oh, say you found me ‚ô™
‚ô™ All my steps are memorized ‚ô™
‚ô™ Swaying to a rhythm so nice ‚ô™
‚ô™ Patterns of my feet
tattoo the floor ‚ô™
‚ô™ They're frozen there
like ice ‚ô™
‚ô™ I dance with
the ghost of you ‚ô™
‚ô™ What else can I do? ‚ô™‚ô™
So sorry. Did I startle you?
You obviously put a tad
too much faith
in your perimeter monitor.
May I?
I wouldn't ordinarily
drop by unannounced,
but I wanted
to grab a rare moment
of privacy with you, Lev.
May I call you Lev?
May I call you Cherise?
I prefer not.
You stole something from me.
I don't know what you mean.
Aelita West.
How much were you paying her?
If someone, theoretically,
stole something.
One would think
that you would go to the police.
Unless, you didn't want the Met
to find out about this
theoretically stolen thing.
Hmm?
What is it you're missing,
by the way?
You see now,
I'd accuse you of playing dumb,
but you seem to be forgetting
quite a bit of
vital information recently,
including the realpolitik
that governs us all.
So...
let's you and I have
a quick review, shall we?
We live in a house
with three walls.
The Klept oligarchy,
through the application
of extreme violence,
managed to bring order
from the chaos of the Jackpot.
And now, in exchange
for rather an open hand
and blind eye when it comes
to the free pursuit of profit,
it helps to maintain that order.
The Met Police keeps the Klept
from straying beyond certain
implicit boundaries.
The Research Institute
benefits from the peace
and prosperity that results,
and in turn provides a
technical assistance for society
to function and thrive.
It's a wondrous edifice
we've managed to construct.
But it's also rather fragile,
I'm afraid.
And what's the roof meant to be?
It's a metaphor.
Oh.
For the thing that will
come crashing down on all of us
should one of the walls
overstep its bounds.
In other words...
the end of the world, Lev.
Oh, dear.
Mm.
Your description of the Klept
left a bit out.
You mentioned the "application
of extreme violence."
There was no shortage of that
in the Jackpot certainly.
But the Klept simply succeeded
where others failed
through a sort of
atavistic tribal unity.
Strike one of us, strike us all.
And suffer accordingly.
I'm sure that you could
express this all
far more eloquently than I can,
using my toast as a prop.
What were you watching
when I walked up?
My wife,
as I'm sure you're aware,
is a member of
the Zolotov family.
Apex predators in the Klept
world, you might say.
So if Dominika wishes to play
with a family pet,
who am I to question her?
Is that how you view
Mr. Netherton?
I'm rather fond of my pets.
Far more reliable
than my friends.
Yuri Samsonov was a friend once.
Wasn't he?
Poor Yuri.
Such a tragic fate.
But also rather
a relevant example
in terms of
our three-walled house.
You see,
Yuri Samsonov overstepped.
The Met Police
resolved the problem
with the technical assistance
of the RI, but...
it was the Klept
who handed Yuri over.
Someone he trusted.
A kiss to the cheek.
Do you know how
the RI accomplished the task?
An assembler swarm.
Tweaked to seek out
Samsonov DNA.
An entire lineage
eaten away to nothing.
Your thoughts, Lev,
I can... sense them.
Can you now?
I hope so.
I hope you're thinking,
"My, what a powerful weapon.
And it's just been sitting
in the RI all these years,
waiting for
the next sample of DNA."
Think on that, Lev.
Have a lovely day.
What's he up to, Wilf?
No more dancing away.
Now you can be my ally here
or my enemy.
Your choice.
But I assure you
it's not an easy path to walk,
being my enemy.
Flynne?
Who the f*ck are you?
Ossian, get up here. Now!
What's happening?
f*cking polts.
Hacked the connection.
Flynne?
Friend of the brother's.
The triple amputee.
Heading for the gates.
You okay, buddy?
Hey, hey, Conner!
Conner?
We're with you, man.
We're right here.
What do you need?
Tell us what to do.
Send me back.
Send me back.
Trick or treat!
This is a private space,
Mr. Netherton.
I don't remember
inviting you here.
I had no idea.
Ash arranged it.
I'm very sorry.
I wanted to address
some issues that have arisen.
May I?
Sure.
What is this?
It's a home movie.
My mother filmed it.
There's a company
that takes them
and turns them
into sims like this.
That you?
Me, Burton,
and that's my dad.
Your father's wearing your jacket?
No.
I'm wearing his.
Burton looks like him.
Oh, yeah,
and he is more
than a little bit conceited
on that fact.
It's a cultural trait,
I gather,
from your part of the world,
to mock the ones you love?
What makes you think that I love him?
You don't?
Of course I do.
It's my brother.
I'd do anything for him.
Do you have any siblings?
A sister.
Then I imagine
you probably understand.
So what are these issues
that have arisen?
Your friend made a visit.
Conner.
What?
It's true.
In your Peripheral.
He informed us of your seizure.
f*ck.
Which he seems to believe
the headset caused.
And I bet you're here
to tell me it didn't.
Well, I have no idea if it did.
You know, that might be
the only time that I'm...
100% sure
that you didn't just lie to me.
Well...
Wilfred.
I looked that up, by the way.
It means, "He who wants peace."
You know that?
I looked
some other stuff up, too.
Didn't find very much,
except a Lev Zubov.
That exists in my time.
But I imagine it's a common name
where your boss comes from.
What did you find?
Mafia thing.
Him, his wife, his children,
daughters, sons,
they were all murdered, shot.
The house was set on fire.
Pretty gruesome stuff.
But no connection to your Lev?
None at all.
Mm.
Get your scan.
In the meantime,
we'll investigate the headset.
We'll only ask you
to return if it's safe.
I give you my word.
You and your word, huh?
I mean it.
The truth twice
in one conversation.
Be careful now, Wilf,
it might become a habit.
There's one thing
I haven't shared.
Aelita.
She's my sister.
Da?
I'm here to see Lev Zubov.
Please put this on, sir.
Was that absolutely necessary?
Some of the club's
more elderly members
don't take kindly to being
glimpsed by interlopers.
I take it you have
good cause for this intrusion?
I, um... I met with our polt.
She shared
some unexpected information.
Y-Your family in the stub.
All of them.
They were killed.
A few weeks ago.
Brutally.
No.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I-I... It's just that I can...
forget how kind
you actually are.
Maybe you do, too.
Makes me worry for you a bit.
That softness under the shell.
Someone targeted them, Lev.
Someone from here, I presume.
What do you think I was
paying Aelita to do for me?
I have no idea.
You made it quite clear that
you don't consider it
any of my business.
We wanted to learn
how to open a stub of our own.
Why would the Klept want a stub?
Why would we want anything?
There's money to be made.
In a stub? How?
The only limit is
one's imagination.
And morals, I suppose.
For example?
My brother Alexei purchased
a pharmaceutical concern.
Even with AI, at some point,
one has to test a new drug
on a human population.
It's a process
that medical ethics
could make rather tedious.
And costly.
So you tested it out in a stub?
Yes, that's just a for instance.
As I said,
the possibilities are...
essentially infinite.
But one thing
troubled me, though.
The idea of different versions
of myself in another world.
The existential nihilism of it.
I just couldn't abide it.
You killed your family?
No, no, no.
Not personally,
no, of course not.
No, I transferred funds and
hired the appropriate personnel.
And I'll tell you
something, Wilf.
I felt better.
Instantly.
In fact,
once we gain the ability
to open these things ourselves,
it'll always be
the first task I'll address.
I would offer
to take care of your lineage,
but I realize your origins
are a bit...
murkier.
Was there anything else
you wanted to share?
No.
Better put
that silly thing back on
and be on your way.
What about,
uh, Ms. Oswald?
Ms. Perry? Ms. Travantine?
Algebra Ms. Perry
or Chemistry Ms. Perry?
sh*t. I forgot about
Chemistry Ms. Perry.
Never took her.
Can't even picture her.
Aw, sh*t, Burton.
The "f*ck" is easy, ain't it?
Ms. Travantine, huh?
Copy that.
Goddamn.
And then, I guess
I'd marry Ms. Oswald.
She's like 90, man.
Yeah, I know, but...
Ms. Perry's the one
who got me to join up.
Said I'd regret it if I didn't.
Chance to do
some good, see the world,
all that bullsh*t.
Gave me a whole f*cking speech.
I thought that was your speech.
Yeah, I took it from her.
Gave it to you
and those other fools.
Okay. She's definitely
the "kill."
A person with manners
might knock.
That same theoretical person
might be a little scared off
by that weird-ass game
you two were playing.
Probably wouldn't be
eavesdropping, though,
would she?
I'm not so sure they would not be rude enough
to eavesdrop.
Would you two both shut the f*ck up?
Please?
Thank you.
Is there a reason you're here,
or you just want to piss me off?
I'm looking
for advice, actually.
You know this Aelita woman?
The one that hired us
in the first place.
Well, we finally found out
where she was living.
And she had this...
this diorama thing of our house.
This trailer.
And of y'all.
Like these little...
toy soldiers.
Leon, Reece, Carlos.
All of y'all.
Your whole unit.
So I guess I'm just wondering:
What the hell
do I do with all that?
They said it was a sim.
When they sent the headset.
And?
Never saw one
you couldn't master.
That's the thing, Burton.
This ain't just another sim.
But you thought it was.
What if you kept thinking it?
Like Conner with his chessboard.
He makes these moves
that set everything in motion.
What do you call 'em?
Gambit.
Gambits, yep.
What's your gambit, Flynne?
What's the first thing
you do when you get in a sim?
Break script.
Do the exact opposite
of what's expected.
And what happens?
I die a bunch.
Look pretty stupid.
And then?
I figure out the rule set.
And then?
I take control.
f*ck yeah.
Easy Ice.
Let's do that.
You and me go in there.
Start dying.
Not without me,
motherf*ckers, not this time.
More boots we got on the ground,
the less likely we are to get
our asses kicked in there.
That's just basic tactics,
ain't it?
You are so full of sh*t, Burton.
You just want to see it.
And what if I do?
Besides, it doesn't matter
'cause you're not
going back in there
till we get
your seizure sorted out.
It's all sorted.
It ain't sorted
till we see the scan.
I feel fine.
I want to go back, Burton.
Okay? I need to.
So you go on ahead
and call Macon and Edward.
It's not like
we got time to waste.
How long do you think
it's gonna be
till someone else comes around
wanting to kill us?
How's your hand?
Everything's back to normal.
Okay? I told you.
I'll get you bodies.
Both of you.
What's wrong?
Where's your father?
Flynne? The children.
Inside. Now.
Am I being used as a toy
when I'm not here?
They needed a fourth.
It seemed harmless enough,
but I apologize.
What are you doing here?
How long does it take to make
one of these?
Why?
'Cause I need one. For Conner.
Another one for Burton, too.
Where are you going?
You see, sim jockeys
tend to have a specialty.
Achievers, Explorers, Killers.
I'm an Explorer, Ash, so I think
now's a pretty good time
to start.
Cut her connection.
Working on it, luv.
But the polts are countering.
Rather adeptly, I'm afraid.
She's leaving.
Best follow, don't you think?
Where in the bloody hell
is Zubov?
Wherever he is,
he won't be happy
to hear our polt's
gone a'wandering.
If the Met Police
encounter her again,
this could be the end of us.
And I mean all of us, luv.
Alert him.
This is
really quite stupid, Flynne.
If you want a tour of the city,
I can happily...
Show me exactly what you
want me to see? No, thank you.
That's not really exploring,
now, is it?
Maybe you can explain
the point of this exploring.
I want to see all the sh*t
you haven't been showing me.
I assure you,
there is absolutely nothing...
Damn it, look me in the eye
when you say it.
I want to see the expression you
make when you lie to my face.
Apologies for the interruption,
Mr. Zubov,
but we have a situation
that is turning somewhat urgent.
The polt has made
an unscheduled visit.
Mr. Netherton's assistance
may be in order.
I'll send him
straight there.
Not here, I'm afraid.
More-more toward Paddington
at the moment.
Though this appears
to be rather fluid.
Oh, for f*ck's sake,
Ossian, cut her connection.
Aye, sir. Brilliant idea.
And-and-and we're working on it,
but in the, in the meantime,
if you could just dispatch
Mr. Netherton...
Oh, you f*cking prat!
Not you, sir.
You don't need to do that.
Yes I do, Edward.
You're overcomplicating this
as usual.
You just got to keep him at bay.
I'm aware how a hacker battle
works, okay? I never lost.
Move. Move.
No, man, you don't know
what to do.
Get out my way.
If you simply tell me...
Aelita told me I'm likely
to die in ten years, Ash.
What do you think
she meant by that?
And where are all the people?
Done?
Did you not hear
my roar of victory
echoing across the rooftops?
"Victory at all costs.
Victory in spite of the..."
Return to the Zubov residence.
What about...?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, Burton? Yeah.
Tell her to shut her eyes.
Shut them now!
That sneaky little prick.
Come on, move, move out of the way.
What? Wait, I got to...
Come on, I told you you'd f*ck this up.
Back again, are we?
What happened
to the people, Ash?
You're certain
this is the place?
According to Ossian.
Head through the gate
and bear right.
We call it the Jackpot.
It wasn't one thing.
Or all at once.
It was everything together.
Building over time.
Even now, they're still arguing
about when it technically began.
It's started, though?
Already in my time?
Yes.
Nice place for a stroll.
She has a right to know,
Mr. Netherton.
A moral right.
Send me the damn code.
What is this?
Our past, your future.
A museum of sorts.
Each of these shapes represents
a different phase
of the Jackpot.
Why "the Jackpot"?
Gallows humor, I suppose.
And it's less portentous
than "Apocalypse."
This is the moment
commonly pinpointed
as the edge of the cliff.
After which
there is no turning back.
The Jackpot was unstoppable.
A hack of the North American
electrical grid.
Complete blackout.
Monthslong, continent-wide.
An increasingly common
phenomenon, as it turned out.
Across the globe.
That's just seven years off
in my world.
Pandemic.
A filovirus.
We called it the Blood Plague.
It attacked the viscera.
The liver, spleen, intestines
filling with blood
till the abdomen burst.
Environmental
catastrophe.
Droughts. Famine.
Antibiotic failure.
Agricultural collapse
followed.
Full population collapse.
Bit more than
seven billion people.
Over four decades or so.
And then came the end.
A domestic terrorist attack
in the United States.
They blew up
a nuclear missile silo.
Spring Creek, North Carolina.
Jesus Christ.
That's where I live.
Geez, just make it stop.
You okay?
You get us bodies?
Um...
I'm working on it.
There are moments when
fate can go one way or another.
Thousand ways it could
have gone wrong back there.
Can't dwell
on the past, Flynne.
What mysteries
do you oversee,
down there in your secret burrow
with the big steel door?
It's getting real hard
to keep this under wraps.
I'm starting
to trust you.
Is that a mistake?
