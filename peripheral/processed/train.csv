"we need to talk contingencies."
"paying Aelita to do for me?"
"that Homeland Security"
"and for Christ's sake,"
"Or Klept, for that matter."
"so she could travel to the f*cking future."
"...but London 70 years"
"Hey."
"Piece of sh*t."
"that we have valued"
"I'm sorry."
"Thank you."
"of power that governs this world"
"isn't he?"
"it might become a habit."
"Mm, how we get along, survive."
"I find you extremely alluring."
"Huh? Answer me!"
"to tell me otherwise."
"As well as the upper tier"
"Seven."
"of your hand."
"Jasper."
"rather closely"
"So I think you got to"
"He's a narcotics manufacturer in your region."
"Which should give a sense"
"Yeah. Thanks for asking."
"I give you my word."
"ten million dollars"
"She appears to have vanished."
"Yes I do, Edward."
"I'm back."
"You obviously put a tad"
"We live in a house"
"You know what, Tommy,"
"To pull me in or out."
"Can you now?"
"Firmly."
"But why do you?"
"â™ª Couples all surround me â™ª"
"to prove that you still got it?"
"just to leave us the f*ck alone."
"Lived a nice, quiet life here,"
"and a Koid."
"where the Peripherals"
"and send me the contact info"
"Just the formula for it."
"I'm almost tempted to call"
"something you're wanting"
"Holy sh*t."
"Married who?"
"Enjoying yourself, Mr. Ice?"
"Macon and Edward."
"and maybe the old man"
"you couldn't master."
"If you feel compelled"
"What people need to know."
"about being"
"That I asked?"
"That f*cked me up"
"And what's the roof meant to be?"
"Hmm."
"No. No f*cking way."
"There's a Klept feel to it."
"overlook because"
"headed toward your place?"
"The rest will be paid"
"I believe, in my own way,"
"filling in for Burton."
"What's your gambit, Flynne?"
"2:15."
"Which would"
"doesn't it?"
"I'm sorry"
"around with one another,"
"you probably understand."
"on the technical side."
"the most urgent matters at hand,"
"You've never told"
"You need to leave."
"makes the mistake of"
"What do you mean?"
"What about my brother?"
"There you go."
"And you'd remember them"
"Then I should probably just act"
"'Cause I've got company, Flynne."
"Oorah, motherf*cker."
"No, it don't help."
"of you, young lady."
"thing I'm good at, Flynne."
"what sort"
"right now? Rational?"
"You want to kill him, don't you?"
"I'm not sure where the term might've..."
"they never really wander close."
"inside a lion."""
"Flynne Fisher in your timeline?"
"The offer has been accepted by a party..."
"Shh."
"Which specific family"
"Where are all the people?"
"am I right?"
"all along, huh?"
"What are the chances?"
"You have to stop him."
"It means they're invisible."
"Your family,"
"why not give you a shot"
"Like what?"
"rather than all three."
"too close to see it."
"to be hella more functional than"
"to share a secret,"
"It ain't a sim."
"to kill you, all right?"
"How 'bout you go,"
"All of them."
"Froze up."
"Beat me to death,"
"What the"
"in 70 years, Ms. Fisher."
"Constable?"
"this conversation?"
"It's a black hole."
"The salmon, thank you."
"What if you kept thinking it?"
"gathering in one place,"
"unless you sign back in."
"Right."
"I assume,"
"but they said that"
"Well, belated congratulations."
"Well, can I go, too?"
"Which is also Aelita's"
"Our implants, turns out"
"I'm gonna get in this car here."
"and help 'em out."
"Burton-Was-Here action."
"Figured you might pop up."
"18 Sackville"
"as daunting as"
"how thirsty they're gonna get."
"For now, at least."
"It seems your brother and his"
"She jumped out of the car."
"It's a bag."
"of the raids on the camps,"
"Look at her."
"Tongue to palate."
"I'm sorry?"
"Yeah,"
"confusing, even for us."
"if they were discovered there,"
"to wrap my head around this."
"Why in the f*cking hell"
"be nice here, gentlemen."
"Where are you going?"
"the last time that worked on me?"
"Maybe tomorrow."
"Do you feel it?"
"It's him, isn't it?"
"of how vulnerable they are."
"with all its horrors,"
"Hmm?"
"Perfect"
"that governs us all."
"Printer 15 jammed."
"You see,"
"Milagros whatever,"
"But I'm afraid I'm not"
"Now you're just"
"that long climb back up"
"I can feel you wanting to."
"here to find things out."
"deal you an awful lot of pain."
"Carlos, too?"
"Does it work both ways?"
"Maybe."
"Always slipping"
"Your new employer."
"of yours, all right?"
"of your origin."
"all that bullsh*t."
"and two peripheral CPUs?"
"And Leon?"
"no more, Leon."
"I thought you said"
"Now what?"
"Burton, this is not working."
"a better tool."
"Never happened to her again."
"With the appropriate weapon?"
"person that he is."
"With an axe."
"Hang your bike on that."
"Nothing. I love you."
"in Mr. Zubov's household"
"My inner child, I suppose"
"Like the ones you just asked me?"
"Everyone knows that."
"That's the sort of wickedness"
"up in the air..."
"In your Peripheral."
"of Lev Zubov."
"Bye."
"anything you could ever do."
"who can save my soul â™ª"
"don't get it."
"my bet."
"I think Mr. Pickett and I"
"a man reaches a point, realizes"
"f*ck you very much."
"more inclined"
"that she can sometimes"
"There's some things"
"hot off the stove."
"to call security."
"really quite stupid, Flynne."
"Which leads me to believe"
"just to make sure"
"Well, that's what you do when"
"As you can"
"tunnel, as you term it,"
"And what's it supposed to do?"
"I prefer not."
"extremely oppressive"
"for bearing me"
"You and your family."
"Your world is on a threshold"
"amounted to the same trait:"
"right at all, no right"
"Link up?"
"I don't want money."
"When I can't sleep,"
"How?"
"Wake the f*ck up."
"No, no, no, no, no!"
"But I wonder"
"So we'll have the rest tomorrow."
"I think you've earned yourself"
"Burton and Ella on Thanksgiving."
"They're like... artwork."
"â™ª What else can I do? â™ªâ™ª"
"you don't want to hear it,"
"What were you watching"
"So, please, take some care"
"make it happen in my timeline."
"Anything else?"
"Let me show you."
"You're only delaying"
"standing here,"
"to you in your world."
"that he's a scorpion."
"till someone else comes around"
"all lived in a paradise once."
"That you?"
"Hmm."
"Killed."
"you're not telling me?"
"Take that up"
"an attacker."
"could prove quite empowering"
"You can't do that."
"Whoa."
"Ossian I could take or leave,"
"Maybe even pick up some other"
"of my tasks."
"find it at all surprising?"
"I wanna call them"
"carve out its eye,"
"when Aelita pressed my eye"
"You see?"
"But he didn't."
"and everyone"
"But, uh..."
"Those Nazis were about"
"in that case we could..."
"I repeat. I cannot"
"Cash, Cash, Cash, Cash!"
"that sounds a tad worrisome."
"considering the frequency"
"I'm not so sure they would not be rude enough"
"the surfeit."
"charges pending on you, too..."
"Anything else going on"
"I told Reece and them"
"able to trace the connections"
"How sweet."
"the data into bacterial DNA."
"because one must always assume"
"old are you, son?"
"Think you might need a little"
"Burton,"
"living-in-the-future wisdom"
"some loose ends, sir."
"tell you straight up."
"understand, Corbell."
"Yeah."
"I heard, on the ride over."
"taking any of that,"
"But if there were one..."
"you promise every time,"
"May I ask why?"
"And because of the haptics,"
"Quite pleased"
"when she shows up to"
"shaking hands."
"It's being"
"while I was there."
"But I assure you,"
"We can start there."
"from it, though?"
"You need to rest up,"
"A stub, as we call them."
"â™ª Got the love,"
"And now what?"
"Here."
"that sort of thing."
"And it also seems"
"in the first place."
"they gave me a name."
"to the draw?"
"And with great care."
"You drunk, Conner?"
"If anything happens"
"are filled in."
"Well, we all know"
"of taking control"
"And I'll count back"
"at life, period,"
"You're either lying, or"
"Thank you, dear."
"Squad of Nazis in the house."
"Witnesses, too, Flynne."
"Told her what?"
"For whom, dear."
"An existentially important one..."
"go through with it, okay?"
"Shut them now!"
"work on you â™ª"
"including the realpolitik"
"to arrange an introduction."
"No!"
"and forty degrees."
"I'm just saying"
"from the Research Institute had."
"for a bit then?"
"Let's keep this moving."
"a way to compensate."
"I felt something."
"We're in the kitchen again."
"why waste a minute being timid?"
"And just getting started, too."
"Flynne?"
"I think"
"which is the weakest"
"I mean, you gotta..."
"Holy sh*t."
"and check the lot myself?"
"They're giving me these drugs."
"All right?"
"Stop him."
"So I worry that you might feel"
"What is this place?"
"Your heart."
"Where's Wilf?"
"â™ª Come on and take my hand â™ª"
"the more you earn."
"but you end up"
"conditions in the stub."
"which is the Jackpot."
"so certain I won't kill you?"
"Just a slowed-down version."
"His location and temporality"
"she don't have, ain't it?"
"Raging. Petulant. Vengeful."
"When you wake up"
"Maybe Flynne will really get"
"Intrepid."
"And?"
"Would you two both shut the f*ck up?"
"That I've time traveled here?"
"of your community."
"Look,"
"to calibrate it here."
"How's that sound, buccaneer?"
"Saw a guy sitting on a stool..."
"Do you value your time, Mariel?"
"algorithmic predictions,"
"for the fences, my friend."
"we've all somehow agreed"
"haven't you, Bob?"
"The R.I. was subject to"
"to the future part"
"Burton's full of sh*t."
"a critical data breach"
"Uh, a, uh..."
"a job interview."
"Completely secure"
"aware she was employed"
"Let's shake on it."
"Like everything else."
"There are moments when"
"'Cause the people"
"we're gonna have"
"Now, I'm gonna offer you"
"a try?"
"into his haptic implants."
"Maybe you and I could come to"
"something for her."
"My boys."
"Don't take my leg!"
"into this man with that"
"I don't f*cking know, Burton."
"Someone with expertise"
"f*ck."
"I'd never even seen him before."
"And I bet you're here"
"Because my story"
"set on toad-in-the-hole."
"The situation is urgent."
"That's part of the problem."
"As long as you use"
"Let me drain some off."
"well, that's pretty much"
"Be a king to my queen."
"You have much more than"
"in Wakefield prison, though."
"Damn it, look me in the eye"
"Our past, your future."
"Birds."
"You can book me,"
"You're a trip, Conner."
"the implications."
"And you did."
"Two of which have been used."
"Mama?"
"What're you mixed up in?"
"That's just seven years off"
"May I watch, Daddy?"
"you'd be here physically."
"There'll be some money there."""
"I'm so sorry, Beatrice."
"if you don't know"
"Have you discovered"
"was actually"
"qualities, if I'm being honest."
"Leon followed us"
"Seems like you're going"
"I was supposed to meet"
"Can you do that?"
"lot more comfortable"
"Let's get a fresh one of these."
"â™ª 'Cause I got the love â™ª"
"I'd suggest you attend"
"of fresh water"
"You thought too"
"I cannot assist you"
"200 grand a week"
"Immediately!"
"Right-wing militia chatter."
"and you're f*cking done."
"Burton. We gotta go."
"oi, into the pot."
"Mind if I have a nubbin?"""
"What's happening?"
"Atticus,"
"Now, you had this"
"messed you up pretty good."
"My pleasure, ma'am."
"So next time, I'll be"
"Thank you for popping by"
"You don't really think"
"Goddamn it."
"Cauterize the wound, son."
"with almond farmers found that"
"tattoo the floor â™ª"
"Salud."
"I got to drop"
"an episode or two here."
"Unless, you didn't want the Met"
"how you might be"
"for someone to come and get us?"
"Because I-I'm just getting"
"Should we call Zubov?"
"John Snow."
"Why the f*ck did you do that?"
"Once you're done here,"
"Dodgy, innit?"
"So much for your"
"I didn't say ""our"" world."
"What, like where I'm from?"
"that the R.I. have ever built."
"after your shift"
"I'm half tempted"
"up with Reece again."
"no f*cking right to be?"
"A drug."
"You gonna share"
"my question, though."
"It's basically"
"I get it."
"catches up with me â™ªâ™ª"
"Lost how?"
"London's calling."
"part of the pleasure."
"already attempted"
"admired about you, Thomas."
"Unsavory."
"â™ª Hey, darlin' â™ª"
"He just ask what I think he did?"
"a moment to acclimate."
"Execute."
"Well done."
"In London."
"Humpty Dumpties"
"a little bit?"
"""Yes."" ""Yes."""
"manhandled you out there?"
"Try 20."
"Then she'd have no reason"
"I'm guessing 28 or so?"
"on trial as an accomplice,"
"with your haptics?"
"keep it a secret?"
"A-And Conner didn't get hurt?"
"You're so frighteningly good."
"or I can start cutting."
"As far as I can figure,"
"Yeah, Gladys."
"Because even after four terms,"
"So you wouldn't want anything"
"our two time lines were identical"
"Oh, f*ck. Gimme a sec."
"I think I want to be"
"what Flynne might get up to?"""
"Apex predators in the Klept"
"Hmm. Of course."
"Jesus f*ckin' Christ."
"I'm just saying, I got to think"
"Well, that ain't"
"Just raise your glass."
"Leon!"
"is what I'm saying."
"No."
"Hmm."
"That is quite a tale."
"'Cause you had"
"Longer you're in,"
"A moral right."
"I can sense your glare"
"The hand with no thumb,"
"quite certain what to say,"
"When you do, swipe,"
"in Jasper's truck,"
"Done?"
"Almost like getting hit"
"then, Mr. Netherton."
"I saw them on a show once,"
"define ""unexpected""?"
"Even got some French toast,"
"Lev is the man"
"None of them managed"
"I'm not asking you to."
"that I ought to stop asking."
"All right, how about this?"
"that you simply wanted"
"I think we should"
"I told you, bruh. I'm"
"You don't think that..."
"You understand?"
"I mean, it's like I'm..."
"My most impressive skill set,"
"and turns them"
"Which is?"
"catastrophe."
"I tell you what to do"
"her next appointment seeing."
"that perfect brine,"
"being a sitting duck."
"Doubtful, given the encryption."
"the most extraordinary eyes."
"Burton into custody."
"in the camps,"
"It helped me."
"f*cking A."
"I, uh..."
"It's not terrible,"
"you might be the last person"
"this process intentionally."
"As far as I can see,"
"Looking pretty fit"
"the whole thing they're gonna"
"Safest route?"
"Here. There."
"Racked up quite"
"How come you never wear 'em?"
"And then?"
"...if I'd ever killed a man."
"Simple as."
"What?"
"to cancel your policy."
"Still feel 'em."
"I won't judge."
"But suddenly, you realize"
"The existential nihilism of it."
"And we saw you there dancing."
"we exited the vehicle,"
"I'd never waste an insult"
"Mr. Zubov in this colonialism?"
"in vigilance, and a whole"
"is it?"
"Droughts. Famine."
"to say about this."
"allows you to communicate"
"where all the money"
"Everything you're saying, but,"
"a far heavier weight."
"Do the exact opposite"
"For that is indeed"
"for the moment,"
"intellectual heroes."
"And what if I do?"
"We can't guarantee"
"Ma'am, if you don't have an appointment..."
"or you won't be paid."
"a far more intriguing adventure."
"ask if you can go home."
"And I'd like to think that"
"don't you think?"
"Stub portals, they're called."
"I'm a-visiting now, ain't I?"
"assist you"
"they all contribute"
"I intend to."
"you not do this again."
"But then quite by chance,"
"No strings attached."
"Atticus! Atticus!"
"The presence of"
"Your friend, Mr. Netherton,"
"Get Jasper to poke around."
"into the camp of,"
"I wouldn't put it"
"But as you're well aware,"
"I assume you'd like to stop her."
"Eternity in an hour."""
"This is London..."
"on that bridge waiting for us."
"Taste."
"Well, enjoy it while you can."
"You"
"find out for certain."
"Don't go over there."
"Un hombre de gran pasiÃ³n, Â¿no?"
"to pull this off on"
"I also know what fidelis means."
"branched off"
"You said..."
"trying to contact me."
"And I mean all of us, luv."
"Conner said that he'd help."
"Just peachy."
"And it's less portentous"
"Yeah, but, Burton,"
"Okay. She's definitely"
"Wolf!"
"They're real people."
"I mean anywhere but the floor."
"Might mean a lot"
"I suppose"
"â™ª And fall on my face"
"Telepresent."
"Now, that's what"
"Well, you see, he promised me"
"If you simply tell me..."
"Go end up in the hospital again."
"of dying things, Cherise."
"intent on stealing a car and"
"So you're warned."
"honestly, directly, thoroughly?"
"We can't afford Pharma Jon."
"direct to the pharmacy."
"I know exactly where you are."
"Though it's likely"
"you can go there?"
"Clarity seemed to require"
"Yes?"
"desperate"
"With Wilf."
"when you get back?"
"to admit how anxious I was"
"You might just want to remember"
"A little venture called"
"What's going on?"
"Are you steady, Ossian?"
"No, I'm afraid."
"We wired payment"
"Hasn't asked yet."
"the facility will be"
"How the f*ck you"
"Looks like they're all grown up."
"wanting to kill us?"
"Trick or treat!"
"Mind catching me up?"
"and Burton Fisher."
"A grisly"
"Well, put it like that? I..."
"they're not the sort"
"two damn passwords"
"Thousand ways it could have"
"But tactically,"
"The Jackpot."
"and what's inside the girl."
"his capacity for violence,"
"I sashay with myself â™ª"
"Burton, I'm done"
"in service yet."
"if you don't have the courage"
"How the f*ck you"
"Send me the damn code."
"In that little bungalow of hers."
"Like I said,"
"fate can go one way or another."
"Don't take this the"
"in that world, Doctor."
"How else you gonna"
"Yeah."
"My understanding was"
"I need that old man alive."
"I'm not getting scooped."
"I got Tommy's order here."
"They're crowning."
"I-I would never..."
"type of motivation."
"We haven't been introduced."
"Fool. Klept. Maybe the Met..."
"Now, I could put Mr. Netherton"
"Someone's waiting."
"and call Macon and Edward."
"something, Wilf."
"to remember, maybe."
"But one momentary lapse"
"Before you make any decisions?"
"Those boys,"
"Enough to wreak havoc"
"has been stolen from me."
"Oh!"
"Shoe leather is what"
"Thanks for the nubbins."""
"with the quiet periods."
"that takes them"
"to give you"
"a clean system, Doctor."
"like the weather."
"She said"
"We'd lose access to the stub"
"That's not true."
"That I'd save you if I could."
"Only in the broader sense."
"You are in grave danger."
"resolved the problem"
"Or Milagros Cold iron did."
"which we are about"
"quite fond of Grace."
"if you follow my drift."
"It appears"
"Who's Jasper's uncle?"
"I don't guess he ever saw it"
"He said to come"
"Yeah."
"You can't really deny that"
"or we go without it."
"You should come by sometime."
"And all that's gonna get sorted."
"â™ª Coyote chewing"
"To send our parents a message."
"what we call a Peripheral."
"I know how personally invested"
"far as we can tell."
"Honestly,"
"you were delivered to us"
"You're telling me."
"North Carolina this morning."
"in a position to help, Doctor."
"Where precisely?"
"f*ck."
"I'd make other arrangements"
"have you done, Ash?"
"Appreciate that, Tommy."
"Take the medical leave"
"He said someone put a hit on us"
"And that you saw something"
"The data Aelita West stole,"
"One way of looking"
"Finally, I decided"
"Got to be a little less subtle"
"Promoting a..."
"the big one."
"Doesn't matter who."
"who got me to join up."
"Aelita's?"
"Look, I'm-I'm sorry, I just..."
"into your account now,"
"Chill, dude."
"Got a visitor."
"they need to vanish."
"Try me."
"I suppose one could see it"
"...you're just as f*cked-up"
"Grains and Legumes."
"your f*cking camper, but me?"
"You mean, like..."
"Was it you hired me?"
"Mm."
"dispatched. Over."
"Have a lovely day."
"So right now, I just need you"
"You want one?"
"a bag full of cash."
"Absolutely."
"the peri isn't a rental."
"I'm a little concerned"
"It's not"
"a missing personal connection."
"Get your scan."
"the f*cking word means."
"Unlike Miss Fisher,"
"A slow, controlled process"
"â™ª I'm a fool to hold you..."
"I'll be listening."
"Bury them."
"at the site of a crime."
"Trying to think"
"it was the Klept"
"Please?"
"that's wonderful news, ma'am."
"Human nature."
"What makes you think that I love him?"
"the support of the others."
"What happens there?"
"of myself, Bobby."
"may be in order."
"you'd likely no longer exist"
"as a certainty"
"what to do."
"There something"
"My two-year obligation here"
"The f*ck am I supposed"
"in any way,"
"What kind of thing?"
"in something that's maybe a tad"
"Billy Ann..."
"in a less loving manner."
"Why don't we take a walk"
"That's the whole point"
"if we don't do nothing about it."
"in my world, then?"
"Didn't. Something called..."
"But he is wearing a vest."
"but he went a fair ways if he"
"that kind of person."
"Is everyone okay?"
"Two abandoned SUVs"
"gave it to you?"
"information to a certain point."
"want us dead, and you just keep getting in the f*cking way."
"So, if they can tell you"
"to mind his own business."
"Not much motion."
"Uh..."
"like it's real or something."
"our AI crutches to lean on."
"a f*cking secret."
"in that exam room,"
"Who they sending?"
"Eliminate Flynne"
"And you let the sheep out 'cause"
"Which was what, exactly?"
"I'm sure of it."
"Is that even possible?"
"I just don't see it, Tommy."
"I can happily..."
"needs of the colony."
"What company?"
"I die a bunch."
"they can manage, Beatrice?"
"Get Mama in the basement."
"and Lowbeer's, too."
"Mama..."
"don't take this wrong,"
"you should probably tell me"
"May I be of assistance?"
"working out the kinks."
"She's okay."
"Seriously?"
"the technical term for it."
"you haven't been showing me."
"Two. One."
"To cut our connection?"
"when, uh,"
"You made it quite clear that"
"sh*t."
"A ""fixer""?"
"And the results aren't"
"for an old man."
"friend and all,"
"are Flynne and Burton Fisher."
"Now, that's where it gets"
"fairytale you needed to hear"
"uh, what do you call it?"
"this sh*t's gonna work."
"They can encrypt their voices"

"All right."
"you'll soon come to regret."
"transmitting the spark of life."
"What the f*ck are you doing?"
"come out themselves!"
"I guess I'm worried"
"It was right there, Flynne."
"I'm all ears."
"Mama."
"to Klept involvement."
"What happens"
"Been worse."
"Okay, you were right."
"I don't know if you know this,"
"Reece!"
"where we first met."
"If you could turn back time,"
"empathy bonuses here, Flynne."
"You feel bad for Conner."
"I didn't see you there."
"Quit mucking about, Angus."
"I'm such a fool."
"And said?"
"it's rather effective."
"makes you a loose end."
"He just said I should"
"if you want it."
"keeping secrets,"
"may save us all one day."
"you log back into the sim."
"that pretty head of yours?"
"to what it's like to go there."
"paying them anything."
"asking after you the other day."
"the Zolotov family."
"Haptic drift?"
"might become aware of"
"Depending upon whom you ask."
"And then I want a body count."
"Despite all that was going on,"
"I need you to get her"
"and I can't help but wonder"
"After which, they'll return"
"and far more perilous"
"Yeah, I've been hearing"
"But I can offer you"
"What is it now?"
"how hard is it to get"
"â™ª Running through"
"So why draw it out?"
"Long ago."
"if that headset is safe."
"10-52. Ambulance being"
"For instance."
"Y'all are afraid of"
"It's just a f*cking game to you,"
"Okay?"
"Perhaps once we input"
"in the same peri,"
"â™ª 'Cause she's â™ªâ™ª"
"I need that old"
"that your deputy's becoming"
"But you need to shut your mouth."
"consider it wasted"
"Is this the liver over here?"
"arteries versus organs,"
"many a time."
"You'll hear a ringing."
"maybe it isn't a sting."
"Going rate a few nights"
"Copy that."
"Tell me that won't be"
"head of security,"
"How else could she be sure"
"you'd become the sort of man"
"You keep looking for Aelita,"
"Cars were cloaked"
"Built long before you joined us."
"What?"
"a desired or intended result."
"He just..."
"really interesting."
"when I could protect you?"
"was just trying to freak me out."
"thinking of you as a friend."
"kill me till she gets it back,"
"Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer,"
"$250,000."
"Untainted by any unattractive"
"Come on, move, move out of the way."
"I gather it doesn't hurt yours?"
"What are you doing?"
"they heard me coming,"
"Slippery. Unmemorable."
"Except for the fact it was the"
"Which is the one thing"
"Aelita says I'm likely"
"Corbell's still hanging on."
"This thing"
"your friends to stop, too."
"And those conversations"
"for a splash of milk."
"What are you asking of me?"
"like two dirt dogs."
"by several degrees of certainty."
"That's supposed"
"and can only hope"
"Yeah, they,"
"What's going on?"
"But I forgot my jacket."
"Unit 204,"
"Any moment"
"for us to accept."
"Siblings."
"the headset again if it's"
"We were playing Flynne and"

"in terms of"
"They won't be the last."
"Watch. This one's fun."
"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure,"
"I suppose that analogy"
"start shooting each other."
"Also, I like you."
"A lawn sloping down to a pond."
"Without the immunity boost"
"Which is why I'm avoiding it."
"there is no turning back."
"I'm not that careless, dear."
"Wasn't feeling well."
"I value you, Daniel."
"...you'd be willing"
"Well, hello."
"ever so slightly,"
"It sounds silly."
"Do you have"
"any shame to say so."
"There's a lot of"
"sites at undisclosed locations."
"right about that."
"But my first memories are"
"Okay, who's up?"
"we can try to trace"
"Business, otherwise."
"in tenth grade, remember that?"
"but what I've observed,"
"And it made me feel"
"Flynne."
"Half a klick up the road."
"we risk losing that connection."
"Something goes wrong?"
"I have to say it:"
"get you up to speed."
"carved and scrawled,"
"when I'm not here?"
"I'll take my chances."
"Angus, let go!"
"Three."
"You made Macon"
"Here but not here."
"True enough."
"so it suits your taste."
"the same thing for us,"
"worth dying for, luv."
"Jesus!"
"â™ª Somewhere in New Mexico â™ª"
"The woman who went missing."
"I'm gonna see to it myself."
"and I was sort of"
"Think of it as something like"
"You can't print this here."
"or demands you might have."
"You know that."
"I can find work anywhere."
"What I mean is,"
"There will be 12"
"we approach this thing like a..."
"if you want it."
"have implants."
"mood. But you..."
"Don't be cheeky, Beatrice."
"the wrong question"
"has been stolen from me."
"the hush-hush,"
"to imagine myself"
"eavesdropping, though,"
"to function and thrive."
"to destroy that son of a bitch,"
"Okay."
"depending on how this plays out."
"to be on your way"
"You're taking too much time."
"Can't dwell"
"Found that I'd beaten him"
"Can you surprise me,"
"everything we encounter."
"through Jesus Christ"
"Aelita brought me back in."
"that a hammer is a"
"all for nothing."
"Someone he trusted."
"the source of Aelita's funding?"
"Do you remember"
"Dr. Nuland, please."
"she might as well be."
"What the f*ck?"
"to understand, though,"
"and perspicacity"
"gonna be no f*cking tractor."
"I should stop by for a beer."
"of what's expected."
"May I?"
"of what kind of bacteria you got"
"Your mate Lev's father"
"And one for my friend."
"top shelf of everything."
"'cause what else would he say?"
"I suppose."
"process this all, obviously."
"if you will."
"And it's a beauty, my boy."
"the station in handcuffs"
"No."
"Okay."
"but I'm not sure."
"It has an eight-hour"
"More drastic than"
"Aelita left a clue"
"to use injured animals"
"And who the f*ck might"
"the hunter now."
"And just a splash of milk"
"That's a 6.8 SPC."
"Sheriff?"
"Yes, sir?"
"Dying."
"Isn't that right, Ash?"
"That's the thing, Burton."
"'cause you made some mistake"
"as I'm sure you're aware,"
"Sim developer."
"We were wondering, Flynne,"
"isn't it, Sheriff?"
"Stay down!"
"for yourself, Mr. Murphy,"
"O Heavenly Father,"
"except a Lev Zubov."
"Get up."
"Have a good day."
"But some folks"
"decades' worth of studies,"
"I want to know what"
"So my technicals have built"
"What mysteries do you oversee,"
"me, so we can finish"
"you go get Burton."
"or you just want to piss me off?"
"I told Billy Ann this morning."
"It's experimental."
"I can't go fixing something"
"Literally or metaphorically?"
"...none of it can hold a candle"
"He'd be connecting to a corpse."
"â™ª It's one of those days"
"New sort of headset."
"I might even respect it."
"But if that were the case,"
"what that calls for, don't you?"
"Mm-hmm."
"I'm afraid the irritation"
"for the foreseeable future?"
"Hmm?"
"the madder I got."
"You thief!"
"one of these nights, Conner's"
"the necessary balls"
"They've been told"
"It's our duty to do so."
"End game!"
"to picture him that way,"
"before we pressure her too much."
"""Howdy, Billy Ann."
"get you people to take my money?"
"Used that to get into"
"Like I was actually"
"I-I don't know what that means."
"Is she planning on implementing"
"So, how's the pain been?"
"I'm blind again."
"Jesus Christ."
"He's not a..."
"I'm sorry?"
"They said that man"
"Adoptive brother to Aelita West."
"I'm not asking you how"
"managed to bring order"
"Call Tommy."
"I don't want to worry them."
"It's technology developed"
"that's rather nonnegotiable."
"to be rude, ma'am."
"And where would you possibly"
"and be on your way."
"my social security."
"and he is more"
"But... what happens to me?"
"Have a seat."
"She's gonna keep trying to"
"Which carries"
"Do you know it?"
"Requisitioned a couple SUVs."
"to eliminate two members"
"on the girl and her family,"
"for Mama's Tamosene."
"Mr. Netherton..."
"As I said, I wouldn't"
"Come here!"
"I might be inclined to trust"
"One would think"
"Jasper's waiting on you."
"in your custody, Tommy."
"And not just"
"arrogant piece of sh*t."
"Well, Rainey was"
"Let's try eight."
"how daunting the odds are?"
"Welcome back, Ms. Fisher."
"was quite explicit"
"to sever the connection"
"running up that ridge,"
"No more clapping?"
"ransom he'll end up charging."
"He doesn't like"
"unavailable to the"
"vital information recently,"
"why would you turn"
"What about...?"
"that way, either."
"in the end, Burton came back"
"You can still drive for us,"
"that you sign back"
"Hundred"
"You? At best, you simply lose"
"it's an eccentric hobby."
"Assemblers can do that, too."
"inside, son, you know?"
"Thief."
"â™ª 'Cause I know we can â™ª"
"I look at all this..."
"Six."
"Try and answer them as quickly"
"Jesus Christ, Flynne."
"Looked a little"
"It's a little hot."
"to ease the pressure."
"Who are you? Homeland Security?"
"That's a question only"
"No."
"What about,"
"One drink,"
"explicitly tell you"
"No."
"Given what just happened,"
"from the stub."
"so someone could"
"and influence in Clanton,"
"In a nutshell."
"with having run away from it."
"It's not working?"
"What's up with your hand?"
"simply misunderstood me."
"I've been living my life exactly"
"Flynne Fisher no longer exists."
"No, he didn't say why. He said"
"without being overheard."
"She mentioned you by name."
"to sever the connection"
"I miss him, Mama."
"This is a private space,"
"Oh. The, uh, compassion center."
"And if I can get it to start"
"Would you summon them, please?"
"I'll be honest, yeah."
"That's for sure."
"She's leaving."
"come morning?"
"Is that what you want?"
"to dictate"
"Tommy, where are you?"
"how they burned us out."
"At the very least,"
"You know what?"
"You were first on"
"this become public?"
"Even in your prime."
"Oh, and, um..."
"deep sleep, confusion, amnesia..."
"who controls it."
"a pretty good ring to it."
"Mi-la-gros"
"I mean, does she get married,"
"but we're talking"
"to come as quickly"
"Yeah."
"What happens if you stop"
"Let's go."
"in your jacket pocket?"
"People."
"Coffee, I guess."
"and only I can end it, so..."
"with three walls."
"Should you happen"
"Macon and Edward run afoul"
"Homeland Security setup,"
"That I stole it."
"with the past."
"he's a fool, is he?"
"...or for yourself."
"self-destructive resistance"
"Nine."
"...I'm afraid I'll need"
"My mother filmed it."
"Thanks."
"for $9 million on the dark net."
"I could guess"
"Well, then, Inspector."
"at the table."
"so she couldn't be traced."
"Oh, Reece, would you tell"
"using my toast as a prop."
"You don't want to feel"
"Does it matter, Mama?"
"a probability or anything,"
"Shake a leg, princess."
"the pee in the right spot?"
"Only seeing ten bodies."
"straight down to business."
"the end of the world, Lev."
"Which..."
"Not a pleasant experience,"
"touch this engine"
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
"Or Radically Immoral."

"killing or disabling"
"Then shot"
"â™ª I've been higher"
"too hard to help a good woman"
"of bad luck yesterday,"
"without some adult oversight."
"Flynne took a trip"
"Calling it a stub"
"that you would go to the police."
"An ad has been posted"
"on the past, Flynne."
"the rest of us."
"Sneaking, too."
"I'm not unhappy."
"it has a name yet."
"Who are you?"
"Start with the party."
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm not saying"
"out of this world."
"Not the kind to suffer through"
"Your eye."
"soundtrack underneath."
"But the sober part"
"it's almost always guaranteed."
"that Peripherals"
"to go scrawl ""MF"" on it."
"So I came up with an idea"
"It's not like"
"Is there something else"
"Burton."
"I can."
"I'll get more intel, if that's what you want."
"For her tumor."
"That silo explosion,"
"for your loss."
"Do whatever you have to do."
"Just Forever Fab."
"You remember the Mad Dogs?"
"I've made a mistake,"
"pretty safe here."
"Don't you think?"
"to give up on. That's what."
"It can all be rather"
"You stole something from me."
"Well, you must've done"
"earlier in the game"
"Where in the bloody hell"
"but to protect"
"Ooh."
"Us?"
"our own interests."
"to draw them into the open."
"no recon."
"in the stub"
"Implementing"
"if that's what you're thinking."
"Why, then?"
"I am simply doing my job, ma'am."
"Or at least I'm feeling"
"...I'd ask you,"
"Mm-hmm."
"she grew angry."
"A what, Macon?"
"Check it out."
"of a stone house if you want."
"the effort proved to be"
"Besides, it doesn't matter"
"making good on his escape."
"to handle a merge."
"with the dog again."
"Bet you get up to all sorts"
"building up inside you."
"there's the other road."
"Sitting down and all."
"a whole lot more"
"You and your family..."
"I don't."
"You're inside what we"
"had many job interviews?"
"Brilliant."
"And who knows?"
"followed by a postictal phase..."
"Now, let's say I decide"
"We do our best"
"but we have a situation"
"But after that point, the"
"I think he was dead"
"do you oversee,"
"don't lie to her."
"What?"
"over the middle in high school."
"Made quite the impression,"
"Which is a shame, because I was"
"in charge."
"Stop visiting Old Havana."
"I save them up"
"against the tree."
"a chance to realize"
"and North African heritage."
"complicated."
"Come camp at our place."
"This exercise should"
"you'd go to, to protect them."
"many a morning."
"You know what my first"
"That was a four."
"How's it work?"
"The Metropolitan Police, sir."
"Makes people feel better"
"Either Aelita or the RI."
"in a nice tight grip."
"and that you helped her do it."
"You know, something I always"
"I f*cking hate it,"
"when someone from our world"
"I'm sure the Klept"
"you give these fancy fellas"
"Mm."
"everything that follows"
"Where was it?"
"Gave it to you"
"Okay."
"making it rough, ain't it?"
"Run by the lowest sort of trash."
"Bit of an argument, actually."
"I wouldn't ordinarily"

"Break script."
"for her."
"Rain falling on the blue tarp."
"You're just too beautiful."
"You ever worry you might shoot"
"...like a giant"
"I'd so enjoy a quick peek."
"I'm gonna f*cking kill you!"
"who makes"
"called Paraguay once,"
"Now, you see, we got people"
"another 554 hours to live."
"on a human population."
"I mean anything."
"This is the one f*cking"
"Of course, Dr. Hogart."
"you selfish, conniving bitch."""
"That ain't who we are."
"You might want"
"In other words,"
"and a scalpel?"
"No. No. I really didn't."
"How much money"
"Yeah, but you know, the thing"
"Has her pain been intensifying?"
"to do with that, Burton?"
"f*ck."
"I didn't figure"

"of the mechanism..."
"I promise."

"Well, two souls"
"or whatever you want"
"Wait, wait."
"It was quite embarrassing."
"They help tide me through"
"Mm."
"There's a lot"
"something else."
"so I would start to..."
"A Met Police"
"sound halfway convincing."
"Conner!"
"not to take any of that money?"
"Has my face been scanned?"
"So I guess I'm just wondering:"
"Nope. That flashback"
"a $9 million bounty"
"Hey."
"Precisely."
"In other words..."
"Look, the offer is there"
"I'm here, man. I'm right here."
"Lights out."
"They needed a fourth."
"someone who has"
"So we can talk"
"There it most"
"Why do you have to go"
"Bit late to ask now,"
"Such a tragic fate."
"What's a Koid?"
"You don't want to hear about that."
"Come on. You know"
"An assembler swarm."
"points definitively"
"â™ª Businessman with"
"You want a stick?"
"we can still find your sister?"
"But I can't help thinking..."
"I'll go here."
"Whoa, now, hold it, hold it!"
"That was Corbell's inclination."
"Flynne Fisher,"
"Even now, they're still arguing"
"of Tommy Constantine and"
"We need"
"Why would you say that?"
"A place you go to, to revive your spirits?"
"Dee Dee? What's happening?"
"as they both drown."
"How do you suppose"
"He must've put 'em up."
"Could very well propel us into"
"Aelita West."
"Why?"
"She always pined"
"come crashing down on all of us"
"with mortality the other night?"
"a grave first."
"I know Daniel."
"Could've told me last night, though."
"The future?"
"Now..."
"And how safe is it here?"
"shall we?"
"So, uh, guess"
"Your thoughts, Lev,"
"this time."
"I was in St. James's."
"it means ""my friend."""
"I've ever encountered."
"I suppose I do."
"ever since you was a teenager"
"with the appropriate"
"Oh, a ""doodad,"" huh?"
"But know what?"
"I want Cherise to know"
"Right."
"No more games, Aelita."
"That the R.I."
"we've been encountering"
"might knock."
"what this is?"
"I just put it on?"
"I was simply informing Ash"
"Used to be a fruit"
"Just do it."
"they were extinct."
"For who?"
"I believe I will."
"She was curious, so I..."
"The Jackpot was unstoppable."
"Yeah. But I realized"
"Hey."
"I'm delighted to hear it, ma'am."
"All right."
"if the job got done right."
"Like Conner with his chessboard."
"to spare you a slice,"
"for many things,"
"Find out what this is about."
"below any level"
"quite informative."
"Not just a fool."
"you are f*cking amazing."
"on somebody's new-mowed lawn â™ª"
"and chose not to believe it."
"electric blue haps."
"sideways, Tommy."
"feeling bad about it,"
"The hour may have something"
"Hmm."
"No, she's the heart of this."
"There are..."
"for that life, though."
"claim ownership?"
"their food at the refectory."
"your mother has"
"a little shut-eye,"
"Saw something"
"looking at, anyway?"
"Chess, fishing, tangled threads."
"He doesn't want you."
"On the surface, you make"
"a friendly warning here, mister."
"Oh, look."
"since the Putin diaspora."
"No, it felt f*cking weird"
"in this den of imbecility."
"I wouldn't be here"
"tractable."
"are overdue for a discussion."
"should you summon"
"It's a clever little device."
"I just want the one pill."
"Trust me, son."
"I think I might need you"
"That seem a bit odd, don't it?"
"You didn't say"
"What's the first thing"
"Folks want me to beta test it."
"Your choice."
"a fork in causality,"
"Hacked the connection."
"so to speak, don't you?"
"I'm not going anywhere."
"to do with that data?"
"Tell me about that tech"
"I'm sure that you could"
"he won't be happy"
"Did you ask him"
"of its own Jackpot."
"Imperialism."
"did we encounter here?"
"in our actual past, you didn't."
"Wilf."
"Ash just now asked..."
"Are we real to you?"
"to make us feel safer?"
"It seems there ought to be"
"All right, all right."
"I need you to open a new stub."
"Dammit, Tommy."
"I guess not."
"to how long"
"Ash arranged it."
"'Cause I'm not just me now."
"That's what's scaring me."
"Why are you here, Doctor?"
"Ah, that doesn't mean I can't"
"feeling, Davis."

"What?"
"Or to be more precise,"
"love if you don't know"
"Are you saying what"
"along with an inclination"
"your timeline..."
"What time"
"Hands down."
"But I also took it to heart."
"Now, what makes you"
"is make her sicker."
"You have a bad habit"
"tomorrow morning"
"Wouldn't you agree?"
"This wouldn't be"
"Corbell Pickett?"
"I'll push it"

"Do you ever count them up"
"Alas, you can't"
"to cover more ground."
"the next sample of DNA."""
"Someone said they would"
"Which is an admirably"
"But nobody's handing out any"
"Do you?"
"You surprised to see me?"
"to live her life now."""

"It's a complicated story,"
"she was playing when"
"It's hot in here!"
"Might take a minute."
"your route back to Aelita's."
"Along with her home,"
"Yeah, I hear that,"
"So you go on ahead"
"Why?"
"of course."
"Shall we sit?"
"It's, uh, quick, easy."
"Luck ain't got nothing"

"And now, it would appear,"
"The polt has made"
"Gift for words, hasn't he?"
"Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer"
"crouching before it pounces?"
"the higher-level officers."
"Seemed pretty f*cking intense."
"Follow my lead."
"Which, I imagine, could make"
"but stupid ain't one."
"Like it or not,"
"There's only one reason"
"than you've all been assuming."
"Can't say I'm liking"
"you wouldn't necessarily notice."
"Are they"
"just let us all"
"it's your specialty."
"Now, I mean."
"Come on, man,"
"I mean, you can imagine"
"You're overcomplicating this"
"that would've been"
"It's good."
"expect you to understand."
"No rebooting."

"you once shot somebody"
"You're telling me"
"is as if you"
"It's waiting downstairs."
"being honest with yourself."
"Which is unfortunate."
"I, uh..."
"where she was living."
"Like you're playing a sim?"
"our relationship."
"$10 million, Bob."
"The Met's"
"It was at least three klicks."
"I assure you."
"or eating a bullet."
"the dark web."
"you know he would have done it."
"Oh, of course not, hon."
"how you feel about that."
"belly up."
"Achiever and explorer."
"Well, I'll tell you."
"in the United States."
"for my taste."
"Are you gonna be all right"

"'Cause you're at one."
"I can assure you."

"â™ª And TW put"
"When I first found you,"
"Much as they can manage."

"And this person you know,"
"You're letting him think"
"Electrified door handles."
"â™ª Pack o' young boys"
"if you want it."
"her sting, trust me."
"Back again, are we?"
"because you chose to."
"something like that here?"
"is scattered rather liberally"
"And the current situation"
"There's a chemical in the tea."
"It's a Colombian company."
"But I put it in the log myself."
"So sorry. Did I startle you?"
"Tyra Ansted wasn't"
"Honestly, one forgets"
"In a stub? How?"
"I own it."
"coming together as one"
"getting stung again."
"But I'll have"
"why you've tracked me down,"
"they're rather complex devices."
"Both Mr. Penske and your"
"Like, enough to set us right"
"The way Burton is describing"
"It was self-defense, Wilf."
"Oh, I"
"some rather vital data."
"I gather,"
"your luck at Pharma Jon."
"and all shall be forgiven."
"Now, Mr. Zubov."
"What the f*ck"
"and dumped them in the woods."
"Your skill set, certainly."
"It's Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer"
"before I stepped out with it?"
"We can talk"
"No plan, no intel,"
"Needs a bit of work,"
"Lev?"
"It's a process"
"Tut had his doubts, I guess,"
"Beatrice exists under a"
"It said the allure..."

"will be coming for a visit."
"Ash and Ossian"
"Some dumb f*ck said"

"Yeah. Trust me, Cash."
"Still fake, ain't they?"
"And you, I presume, are"
"You're all rainbows"
"Immediately, I'm afraid."
"some rather interesting"
"a snake on my back..."
"all over the place."
"You don't know"
"Mm-hmm."
"Get him up all the way."
"I'm afraid that"
"I thought that was your speech."
"how to fix a car."
"What is it you're missing,"
"what he wanted in exchange?"
"Don't be stupid, Wolf."
"You disappeared on us,"
"And there ain't a single f*cking"
"Never f*cking again."
"I was trying for"
"And costly."
"I speak,"
"and I'm like a thought"
"a bad good-girl,"
"what I'm asking you, Conner?"
"The R.I. Headquarters was"
"Done. Link me."
"What's it feel like when"
"about the Tex-asses"
"How you figure?"
"No f*cking way."
"need them so much anymore."
"Backlash and repudiation,"
"What is it?"
"I believe in you."
"it looks like it's almost"
"the young lady"
"Okay."
"despite their cooperative"
"Which means you working"
"a little dimwitted, then."
"kill that bitch."
"What kind?"
"Wasn't he"
"self-explanatory,"
"She shares hers with others."
"Afraid I might beat you"
"I'm gonna win."
"Tell you when I get back."

"Urgent, like the people coming"
"The data you're bringing"
"so come on,"
"ought to cover such expenses."
"guardian angel"
"if you know anything about it."
"some local knowledge."
"let's approach this encounter"
"What do they want?"
"like nice folks."
"I repeat: suspect at large"
"Are you ready?"
"a few questions,"
"I want to kill someone."
"Three klicks might as well"
"Alert him."
"Please. Please don't."
"Doctor told her"

"So maybe two dozen?"
"drag those crosses over"
"the needs of the Institute"
"I don't lie to my friends."
"I don't know what it is,"
"Oh... you know."
"There's something about"
"That thing that the Romans did"
"Intriguing."
"Would you wake from here"
"a bit less bleak."
"being bulletproof."
"It's already happened, luv."
"like a firefight."
"it. Yeah. That's it."
"A way of skirting free"
"the hard part yet."
"And then, such a thrill"
"Far as I can tell,"
"seem too concerned"
"I know next to nothing."
"What?"
"Chops the f*cker down."
"dropping off an order for Dee Dee."
"It looks like me."
"to pay the slightest"
"erased from the"

"at the door on the left."
"so I kept letting people"

"Turn right at the corner."
"And he had one of those"
"But you went"
"on such short notice."
"Nothing"
"Gave me a whole f*cking speech."
"I don't think I'm following."
"explain everything."
"I'm starting to trust you."
"Look, can I just get the keys"
"Why are we stopped?"
"Maybe."
"Theoretically."
"Shall we?"
"They're Peripherals,"
"in the coming hours,"
"Abandoned for days"
"I lifted the veil,"
"Which you could maybe help with."
"guaranteed."
"was twitch a finger."
"the ""thou shalt not"" of it all."
"I never seen that place before."
"I was trying to exploit"
"f*ck, what was it?"
"the whole benighted region."
"performance review"
"to know one, that is."
"Appreciate the beers."
"Less than it would take."
"how long could she last?"
"Who's that?"
"and I will get right on that."
"How should I proceed, sir?"
"Checkmate..."
"Go home."
"of the work you're doing."
"And please scrub"
"Oh, yes, sir,"
"You're too transparent."
"Registered, Mr. Ice."
"Pain, too."
"What happened to her?"
"Just like the other sort"
"They attacked the school."
"And I know it's dumb, okay?"
"Them not wanting to"
"Piloting that body"
"this right out in the open,"
"think how it must look to them."
"feeling like an idiot."
"May we be of assistance,"
"Talk to me, sweet pea."
"She's our best chance"
"I mean..."
"No, no, no."
"your opponent's response."
"Y-Your family in the stub."
"It's all right."
"Now, the more I know,"
"I'm missing something obvious,"
"Always a sucker"
"You're a fool."
"some pressure here."
"But I'm gonna need your help"
"Tell us what to do."
"Every single vector"
"I appreciate it."
"some sort of fungus."
"...she's still inside you."
"But I imagine it's a common name"
"what we call a Peripheral."
"too and either one of them"
"So..."
"May I?"
"Your crown of laurels."
"anything, did you?"
"Who?"
"You sure this is where it is?"
"Sort of like what"
"If I understand this correctly,"
"which I suspect"
"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no."
"with a little bit of advice?"
"'Cause like you just said,"
"we can't afford to waste."
"How may I be of assistance?"
"at such riddles."
"I need to ask you something."
"Now. He's here to kill us."
"You lack clearance"
"a local matter, now, don't it?"
"Oh. Yeah."
"What if I want"
"Of course."
"from where I live."
"She shared"
"Am I right?"
"Indeed, ma'am."
"Nothing was put into evidence"
"All right, then."
"If this sh*t is harming Flynne,"
"with the alliteration"
"to the free pursuit of profit,"
"This is home, Jasper."
"Go back to that level"
"if I stop taking them?"
"with Lev and his two technicals."
"with Sheriff Jackman."
"Not at all."
"Aelita?"
"Or gone to ground so thoroughly"
"I fear"
"that it'd be better, but..."
"Oh, I'm well aware."
"Yeah, I'll do that, Tommy."
"Mama, please tell me"
"if you'd left her out of it."
"man was carrying."
"in the past week"
"but we need the intel."
"talking about, Tommy?"
"So..."
"if you get my meaning."
"I'll confess I always"
"his most recent scan, Doctor,"
"That's what makes life so hard."
"in a manner that will destroy"
"ready-made small-unit cohesion."
"Don't you worry about that."
"Do you still wake up like that?"
"He's not a fool."
"How you got us all"
"probably just 'cause"
"There you are."
"...if I'm lucky."
"one of those situations"
"seven or so minutes from now,"
"Yeah."
"Look, I'm not a doctor, Conner,"
"Left."
"And whatever the hell"
"Though I do imagine"
"and open some doors for me."
"May I go home now, Constable?"
"Although in this particular"
"Funny thing"
"that's just a grain of sand"
"The pitch is rather high."
"Environmental"
"I try to solve"
"handy the other night."
"is Zubov?"
"Oh, dear. No, no, no, no, no."
"â™ª Dreamin' 'bout"
"Building over time."
"Well, I'm guessing"
"a better explanation?"
"Nah, Burton has"
"a lawful authority,"
"f*ck's sake."
"You really think"
"teeth out,"
"Yeah, you are."
"in the future, huh?"
"so I guess we're even."
"You've been both in your time,"
"of behaving as if"
"amount of energy,"
"much from the incident."
"They need you in London."
"We wait."
"They don't take fondly"
"we have ourselves"
"I mean, I..."
"all it's gone and done"
"I know you're uneasy with this."
"I mean, they got these"
"I'm gonna give you"
"I think the young lady"
"â™ª With silver bells"
"magically f*cking showed up"
"they're still out there."
"I suppose that this"
"I've arrived."
"There ain't."
"okay, but I had to stay here."
"As your body processes it,"
"to the sound of your voice,"
"Well, you don't"
"The go-along-to-get-along road."
"It's not you"
"Is that saltwater?"
"or I can send her myself."
"the shells."
"It's like you said."
"No."
"the polt for her seizure,"
"please call..."
"but thank you. You go at it."
"Let us out!"
"and have a look."
"Did I or did I not"
"You're in grave danger."
"Well, there are"
"run of luck lately."
"Should I let them out?"
"didn't anticipate"
"I hate to break it to you,"
"That's a f*cking crow, Leon."
"in the lead-up"
"uh, Ms. Oswald?"
"who'll be coming for me, well..."
"trying to contact me."
"find the son of a bitch"
"if that's a compliment"
"again, I will carve you up."
"as a sort of honor."
"There's precedent,"
"let that go."
"on the branch"
"all that evil stuff"
"That's Reece's truck there,"
"Yeah!"
"Look, I know you've been"
"What?"
"to keep this under wraps."
"for friends and family."
"And, of course,"
"She sampled our f*cking DNA."
"Then you need to send me back."
"We get it."
"I'm sorry, Flynne."
"Is there any way that Aelita"
"to see you, Ella,"
"So frighteningly good."
"with the polt's brother."
"But about you, my dear..."
"or venality or simple stupidity,"
"when I was young."
"for me to slip out the back."
"It stopped after my dad died."
"I've said all I know"
"to call it..."
"he asked us to speak with you."
"It was just..."
"All I'm saying is there are"
"for your service."
"Ah, yes."
"details will fall into place."
"perhaps you can explain why"
"Look, I don't want to be"
"It's just stiff."
"Lying to him like that."
"No, it's true. Ten years."
"Exactly as I feared."
"less benign manner."
"of his recent adventures"
"So..."
"Next ambush..."
"Just my team."
"One of the old ones."
"Our next visit, you'll be"
"Around the corner."
"All I'm asking"
"What is it?"
"My assumption is"
"messed me up"
"Which are?"
"Is she okay?"
"two kilometers out."
"he's in charge."
"And we all appreciate that."
"And then, I guess"
"You all right? Knife."
"For the rest of your lives."
"Now..."
"could you and Edward"
"Oh, no, Burton. The bodies."
"He survived"
"This here's the only way"
"Burton, get up here right now."
"Burying and burning have both"
"Burton said in Texas"
"that you lost?"
"Huh?"
"stole something."
"That's very kind of you to"
"How do you know?"
"Now, you won't get"
"Yeah, I think we're gonna have"
"why people are trying to come"
"the new branch causally unique."
"Here. Allow me."
"you're telling Jasper, too."
"that I keep thinking on..."
"be bygones, and all that."
"hired the appropriate personnel."
"we're in his garden"
"â™ª Patterns of my feet"
"â™ª All alone and lost â™ª"
"In ten words or less, please."
"The city wants"
"Are they the same, or what?"
"Printing toppers"
"Kind that's registered"
"Or do you just intend"
"Atticus!"
"Do I get another big-ass beard"
"Miniature worlds in which"
"Listen, gentlemen."
"Telling yourself whatever little"
"I'll tell you everything."
"Send me back."
"a little concerned, Sheriff,"
"my money back..."
"a f*cking brain scan."
"that you might save"
"all puppy-eyed for me"
"Or rather a past, since"
"â™ª I need your help..."
"Kick it out, man!"
"â™ª I have paid the cost â™ª"
"What happened?"
"What time is it?"
"Say goodbye to..."
"And then,"
"why she needs to play"
"members of the Mad Dogs cartel."
"Nod your thanks."
"I'll come back here tomorrow"
"to do with this?"
"how do we get these serviced?"
"And they stonewalled me."
"adult for a f*cking change."
"Oh, and, Burton,"
"You understand."
"working to stay stone blind"
"Â¿No esposa esta noche, SeÃ±or?"
"lying there,"
"Run along to the kitchen."
"You want a peek?"
"We look out on all this"
"and as my guest."
"I was trying to get"
"Even now I'm getting confused."
"when you're fishing,"
"Oh, f*ck."
"There was contagion"
"Quite modest, really."
"of trouble on your own."
"that's what they call it."
"A lot can happen"
"about your mama,"
"You got your whole little posse"
"whether you realize it or not."
"You?"
"Or did they fix that?"
"Eyes are human."
"I'd like to keep her"
"in your drawing room,"
"we need some help right now."
"Know what's startling?"
"Corbell and I, we get set free"
"Perhaps not even quite that."
"with Mama?"
"My recruitment of an asset"
"come hunting us down?"
"interrupted by the shock"
"Obviously, it ain't okay."
"the $2.5 million."
"if that's any solace."
"and have none of this"
"and done."
"It's hot in here!"
"Burns it."
"It was a joke."
"That's not why I'm here."
"We're gonna do everything"
"it runs on AI."
"Those words could end up"
"You've been keeping us"
"Each of these shapes represents"
"Our tech, more or less,"
"not only been swapping"
"appointment or not. Reece,"
"there is absolutely nothing..."
"that I believe him."
"...it felt a little"
"What is it?"
"rest of your plan."
"Ah."
"Oh, just tying up"
"I'll get your money back"
"I ought to be seeing"
"Motherf*cker!"
"Your wife looked lovely, Lev."
"Which one?"
"Yeah, but there's four of us."
"You're just a normal guy,"
"The offer has been accepted"
"put our heads together"
"Those first days in the hospital"
"Come on, Billy Ann."
"And where else"
"here, Flynne."
"that I was actually there."
"I promise."
"And?"
"It's been years."
"f*ck yeah."
"where they'd be untraceable."
"And he just told you"
"on your line"
"Like they already knew"
"a tad agitated, I'm afraid."
"It's an augmentation."
"Who?"
"she's planning on blowing up"
"Linked."
"Ah..."
"their car window."
"I give you my word."
"would you want to do that?"
"Pretended to be dead."
"for you to issue"
"It's a wondrous edifice"
"It's so tiresome to have you"
"Flynne's been using."
"in this regard, ma'am."
"Silly is what it is."
"of an eventual ten,"
"Okay."
"Off the top of my head,"
"What happens to this thing"

"In my experience, though,"
"I'll get you bodies."
"we best get busy."
"misguided conversation."
"I should be aware of?"
"She really loved you, Wilf."
"anything of substance, Doctor."
"John 20:29."
"Yes, I know what it is."
"the capacity to act in mine"
"And then we can keep going,"
"What's up? You got"
"Scratch your way out"
"you can get to a level"
"with admirable dispatch,"
"him. He's moving."
"more or less comatose"
"I need to kill two people."
"For my sins, I have continual"
"get some clothes on."
"memory of you is, Flynne?"
"the possibilities are..."
"What you doing here?"
"The f*ck's that supposed to be?"
"The Sistine Chapel moment."
"on my daily constitutional,"
"Thousand ways it could"
"a person's attention span."
"And pull up"
"moment."
"that, Tommy. But, uh..."
"Powering down now."
"the opposite of how you've"
"Call me if there's"
"to keep this under wraps."
"Remember?"
"to mock the ones you love?"
"Tommy Constantine was"
"As you most certainly are."
"And how safe"
"I honestly..."
"Open."
"to help, Conner."
"Because if I did,"
"Have her sent up, please."
"I do admire the brute"
"It could save us, Conner."
"What you did to those neoprims?"
"Dispatch, shots fired"
"our neural adjustment mechanism,"
"who I had in custody."
"'Cause my uncle understands"
"truth in it for my comfort."
"Mirror, mirror on the wall."
"etiquette here, doesn't it?"
"You can tell me the truth,"
"Which was a joke."
"and Lowbeer's, too."
"a sum of money involved"
"Then, you know,"
"That man is loose"
"to this present moment."
"Just to make it clear,"
"more realistic than that."
"...or we go with mine."
"why don't we link up again?"
"Come."
"My hangover, I imagine."
"themselves involved"
"Aelita knows."
"Across the globe."
"So, what's troubling you?"
"Mr. O'Connell?"
"Atticus!"
"in my own timeline."
"How's the charge on that?"
"make when you lie to my face."
"die, or my children will,"
"Kids who grew up together offer"
"The Aunties?"
"I felt like you deserved it."
"this thing through."
"murkier."
"I'm sorry."
"Act on, you mean."
"Lev Zubov knows this,"
"It can be a deadly weapon"
"So this quantum"
"in the system, swab my DNA,"
"Burton, she's a friend"
"You get us bodies?"
"Not many do, in my experience."
"Wishing I could do it."
"I'm afraid that might prove"
"What do Neoprims have"
"I mean, how could you not..."
"She knows you're here."
"But I do want to see"
"I hope you're worthy of it."
"We used those"
"then I'll be gone."
"Damn."
"...if you want it."
"when they see me coming"
"Up or down."
"Indeed."
"Too much of a good thing"
"and I mean all of them."
"Flynne, but..."

"You having the chance"
"the supposed impregnability"
"This here's"
"There it is."
"You want a hand?"
"You see now,"
"Piloting that body"
"You're acting like the frog"
"It's started, though?"
"in Virginia Water."
"How'd you get this number?"
"who'll be coming for me, well,"
"Cold iron."
"Give it back."
"Not till you're dead."
"that the medication in question"
"at Corbell Pickett's house."
"We traced the operator."
"You'll be fine."

"in Notting Hill."
"far beyond the level of need."
"and economic turmoil"
"her visit as soon as possible,"
"It worked."
"Time to cut bait."
"How, Burton?"
"We'll talk about it first."
"Mariel? Afterward, I mean?"
"Tommy and his sheriff"
"has revived."
"Holy sh*t."
"I look at you and..."
"a nice, healing lilt."
"But even more so,"
"What's he doing,"
"Wanted to run it by you."
"I can take one look at you"
"â™ª And I got to make it"
"the month in the process, too."
"bit of help with your math"
"After all these years,"
"Okay, right, and you"
"Let it be preparation"
"I'm sorry, Wilf."
"Would have guessed as much."
"This is"

"You want to guess why"
"You hear me, son?"
"Oh, it's a doodad, you"
"But I deeply regret"
"Yeah. And Reece would do"
"We're in Notting Hill to meet"

"Almost like a picture, ma'am."
"Already in my time?"
"I thought we should"

"Let me hit you"
"Hmm? Where's that"
"I'm sorry I said"

"Not as a deputy."
"It ain't gonna happen."
"Seems"
"And what's your guess?"
"Frank's back in the house."
"And do you know what she meant?"
"But that's the kind of"
"Perhaps we should stick to"
"Oh, Jasper."
"The offer has been..."
"Great."
"Made it a nice place"
"Brought you some coffee."
"You do recall"
"to keep us together."
"Good."
"Mr. Zubov, but"
"it... knife work."
"we had about Monopoly?"
"to kill a girl."
"wanting to kill us?"
"and I was a good bad-girl."
"In the meantime,"
"it sure as hell sounds true."
"I had the same thought,"
"where your boss comes from."
"I don't mean"
"called the banana."
"Unless you realize"
"May I call you Cherise?"

"I'd give an arm and a leg"
"The man from the bridge."

"Then maybe you should stop"
"If I assured you that"

"I might've let it slide,"
"That bear any resemblance"
"Pull back. I'm coming up."
"But it wasn't really"

"Hey, how come everybody here"
"a recipe to cook, then."
"I had nothing."
"if I ignored her requests"
"hired a hit man"
"But it mattered to me."
"Wilf."
"And the colder one on the floor?"
"A whole new person."
"I told the nurse,"
"Jump in real quick."
"the only world that I got."
"I'll consider us even."
"works, okay? I never lost."
"Guess I wouldn't spurn"
"Where's Conner at?"

"They'll..."
"Sitting here like this."

"The act of connection produces"

"Why can't we just tell him what"
"It's all right."
"f*cking made it up."
"Is there something"
"The entire library, I suspect."
"I'd like to propose an alliance."
"when you link up"
"Mr. Pickett, he, uh..."
"Yeah."
"talking? Let's get this done."
"Well..."
"Quite the contrary."
"with such an unpalatable world?"
"Billy Ann."
"a conversation."
"We got a situation on our hands."
"wouldn't you?"
"Look familiar?"
"Trigger his ANS."
"â™ª And cockleshells â™ª"
"from his IP address."
"arrogant, for instance,"
"Charles must've thought,"
"For use as a laboratory to"
"Um, adjust, please."
"Maybe you should try"
"Oh, f*ck."
"Yeah, I know."
"we're gonna pay"
"I'm unavailable to take your call."
"Who told you?"
"You don't really think Aelita..."
"Well, I can give it back,"
"You'll most likely"
"When you think about it,"
"To what end?"
"I had hoped would be necessary"
"So I need cash. Now."
"How do we access the bacteria?"
"and not particularly relevant"
"You okay?"
"Has a real poetic ring,"
"Scorched earth."
"I've already called it in."
"You'll see some blue rams"
"Can you hack it?"
"which is what the young"

"Rather brilliant, I"
"Hey!"
"Get it done, Reece,"
"Speaking of which,"
"I'll do anything."
"to see you again,"
"environmental pressures have"
"some might argue."
"a way to accept it."
"I ought to come in"
"Two. One."
"Look pretty stupid."
"Working through it"

"You're too young"
"And they had you down at the"
"The ""f*ck"" is easy, ain't it?"
"you want."
"And all I got to do is"
"If the Met Police"
"Good man."
"if our implants subtly goosed"
"that you do not ask her that."
"How much of a warning?"
"who killed our families, Wolf?"
"I certainly don't take offense,"
"It's gonna beat your"
"Lev and I went slumming it"
"you needed the rest."
"Holy sh*t."
"That's Reece."
"What's wrong?"
"Tell me, Dee Dee,"
"I mean, to his core."
"for domestic companionship."
"of the company is and all."
"whatever the hell it is."
"She has a right to know,"
"with such alacrity."
"And by right spot,"
"Dr. Nuland."
"Gonna rob a bank tomorrow?"
"That's how they fly."
"and those other fools."
"Billy Ann, give it back."
"under this beautiful green turf,"
"in charge all of a sudden?"
"It's a cultural trait,"
"something like that?"
"You're always off in some corner"
"You, uh, you got any idea"
"Follow me."
"Bitch. I'm quite certain."
"stupid drone tournaments."
"Night. Love you."
"this diorama thing of our house."
"Yeah, we have a new add-on"
"All the things"
"Someone's got to do something,"
"It would complicate"
"When there's a blight"
"On your hands."
"Nice to meet you, Beatrice."
"Let's just say I'm special."
"They tell you"
"there was only darkness,"
"which, as you know, is a highly"

"Hey. Hey. Flynne?"
"No, no, no, no, no."
"A citizen of Canada."
"when all the while,"
"How about I sing, then?"
"And you don't have time"
"It ain't sorted"
"they call air around here."
"than my friends."
"Next in line!"
"Like a game?"
"What?"
"Well, almost."
"â™ª And pretty maids"
"We don't know what's in it."
"I could easily eliminate you."
"to the damn thing."
"like a warrior king, didn't he?"
"rather more tenuous"
"was coming from."
"the specific technology?"
"from the bridge?"
"Atticus, wake up, man!"
"that is turning somewhat urgent."
"Couldn't bear to have the fifth"
"an interesting tale"
"town, family,"
"Is it true"
"You okay?"
"Welcome back."
"Want to apologize for that, too?"
"Forgive me."
"Wanted me to rent"
"another question, I know."
"I can't seem to..."
"I didn't have any good sense"
"It's okay, hon."
"Telepresent."
"Reece. ""Your mother"
"How good you are at this?"
"They got a good thing going"
"to talk this through."
"Whoa, babe."
"What's that?"
"about you taking Mama's pills."
"tube for... the eating."
"One thing I know for sure."
"Reece is the one in the beret."
"I assumed you'd already done that."
"â™ª Hey, darlin' â™ª"
"keep me in a box"
"indulge in too many scruples."
"should she choose."
"Ah, f*ck, I feel sick."
"the evidence I collected"
"That's all the assistance"
"if they want."
"maybe you and I could"
"My uncle had a saying,"
"On foot."
"and prosperity that results,"
"put on my phone."
"hustled into the brush."
"You have to admit"
"evening, Manuel."
"I'm calling in sick."
"The one that got him"
"in our own society."
"Easy Ice."
"Easy Ice, eh?"
"your secrets, too."
"My job?"
"He doesn't want nothing for it."
"What type of procedure?"
"Fair enough."
"my grievance against."
"that-that... Texas..."
"All right, Mama."
"too great, either."
"so you can feel"
"in the war on occasion."
"Then what will happen?"
"That's it. Exactly."
"Burton."
"I'm sorry."
"I can't help but think"
"not even the queen herself,"
"and acting like you're"
"of the hive."
"our three-walled house."
"Aelita told me I'm likely"
"No ID, no registration, nothing."
"one Daniel Cook."
"Um..."
"little ball, right?"
"with a bit of luck on his side."
"Well, don't call it again."
"And?"
"But if you..."
"What's in the box?"
"A thousand, if I make it to the next level."
"see how you're holding up."
"when it's laid out like that."
"Be careful now, Wilf,"
"I presented a possibility"
"Folks with power, money,"
"and presumed armed."
"Speed, intensity, and"
"which bid on a contract"
"I-I didn't mean to"
"It appears"
"I do."
"...just for the pure"

"Damn, Flynne."
"A Neoprimitive."
"didn't look much like her."
"The Uncanny Valley"
"There's"
"If somebody had been"
"the straight and narrow approach"
"How?"
"And when you see me"
"No."
"Clearly you've got some other"
"But I will cut off a limb"
"They hacked us back."
"my deep neural network,"
"About what?"
"on my desk the next morning."
"Or we on our own?"
"I assure you"
"I'm something."
"I ought to protect her if I can."
"Burton said to fetch this home."
"Before we evolved"
"If Dr. Nuland has"
"Jasper Baker."
"Wilf."
"from the department."
"Have you input anything?"
"I fear we're getting"
"to kill me and my family?"
"No."
"all the men early on."
"First installment"
"to come in my room"
"of that particular sandwich."
"So we got Dee Dee,"
"The oddest thing"
"The individual"
"may all seem"
"Tell me,"
"Under my supervision"
"Remind them"
"y'all didn't find that map?"
"because I'm confident"
"Next one's in the head, old man."
"no longer exists."
"Part of me, naturally enough,"
"It felt rude to interrupt."
"Who would have ever guessed"
"and the fatal flaw..."
"Cherise Nuland to deal with,"
"You just got to give me a little"
"the least challenging"
"their natural lives."
"about how I, Clanton's"
"if you do me a favor."
"feeling spontaneous."
"What do you want me to do?"
"Just to brighten up my day"
"an impressive body count"
"of contacting"
"You know that."
"For almost three years."
"Before you accept"
"Yes, you did."
"bred to be feral."
"You-you want an apology?"
"They'll get you sorted out."
"All I need is a quick"
"I'm afraid we had our hearts"
"So, uh..."
"Follow Beatrice. She'll"
"And you have no f*cking"
"How can I be of help?"
"a cleaner place,"
"My mama dying."
"to fetch it for me,"
"a sitting duck."
"They go about their business"
"Who?"
"left a bit out."
"Flynne happened."
"it'd be a little"
"Wilf..."
"It's anyone even remotely"
"pretty odd to me, Tommy."
"No, I started"
"It was forest,"
"Could've just stayed"
"Cherise Nuland can answer."
"when I expressed confusion."
"Your drastic step..."
"That's my understanding."
"It was wrong."
"Hey, you want"
"My town."
"details like this"
"You're all rainbows"
"You all right, sir?"
"Man, sniper three klicks away'd"
"Headset?"
"Names, Ms. West."
"What's the worst"
"Ossian, cut her connection."
"if you could just dispatch"
"It's a metaphor."
"They don't muck around"
"this time or what?"
"might count as a good deed."
"To what end?"
"I don't believe you."
"Burton! Open up!"
"uh..."
"You want to talk some sense"
"It's bacterial."
"complicate the situation,"
"What are you playing?"
"Then you're"
"to say he's our friend,"
"until you embrace"
"Intel says there's chatter"
"I'm working on it."
"You will never be"
"Which is meant"
"That just about makes sense."
"Take the money."
"Open and shut."
"for you, aren't I?"
"The f*ck did I ever do to you?"
"who gave the scorpion a ride"
"by the Research Institute."
"An English doctor."
"I was about to make"
"ain't really on my side â™ª"
"you want to tell me?"
"A surprise."
"witness around to prove it."
"All right."
"bull pup there."
"Okay, it was me who picked up"
"I'm worried about you."
"So if they told you"
"what I promised, I assure you."
"You don't have a choice,"
"Yeah, he did."
"I hope you didn't eat too much."
"One skin grows"
"of mine, okay?"
"You've probably"
"the whole lot'll follow suit,"
"if Wilf could join us."
"Are you trying to call"
"back the station."
"Or is she still alive?"
"What do you, uh..."
"Goddamn it."
"not tell people stuff"
"necessary, Doctor."
"she first came here."
"as cold-blooded as you"
"Talk to 'em one-on-one,"
"we never really have much"
"Yeah, okay."
"on a larger beach."
"Now a Met koid is following her."
"We were still crawling out"
"How's your mama doing, Flynne?"
"you'll have to adapt to."
"Not personally,"
"Damn it, Flynne."
"makes it a bit easier"
"Say it."
"What do you think I was"
"But the Klept simply succeeded"
"straight there."
"before I could."
"Oh, no, you sound"
"Drop your f*cking gun now!"
"I can't have you"
"I got it."
"A f*cking doodad."
"I imagine."
"The whole f*cking tree."
"in a real place?"
"just a form of dancing."
"The Met Police"
"I grew up in this town."
"you're in grave danger."
"The stub..."
"the f*cking car over."
"Hey, hey, Conner!"
"Yes, ma'am."
"you don't consider it"
"No ""doodads."""
"We've found that a lingering"
"others for your failures,"

"Also a tonic-clonic is generally"
"I might."
"none of that's at play"

"now has our guy."
"with the simple wave of my hand."
"Leon, Reece, Carlos."
"â™ª It's 4:00 a.m.,"

"what your sister believed"
"don't you?"
"What the f*ck?"
"With some new kind of"

"Pretty damn certain"

"I know a lot of terrible sh*t"
"Mm."
"Everything."
"of the occipital lobe."""
"to whatever she might be asking."
"of finding Aelita."
"Sort of like Burton seems to be."
"you are here, Wilf."
"correct, for the most part."
"Keep going."
"Whoa!"
"She can leave of her own accord,"
"Dig a hole, love."
"of... of weighing you down"
"He went out fighting."
"You know, that might be"
"This is where the camp was,"
"You almost got killed."
"Peripherals."

"they were all murdered, shot."
"f*ck."
"Which is?"
"What do you say, Bob?"
"But if there's a moral in it,"
"It's actually quite simple."
"Rather easily."
"What's your real name, lad?"
"those drugs came from?"
"You need to lie"
"But we aren't"
"â™ª I'm a fool to want you â™ª"
"but here's the thing."
"And I want to know who it is."
"head on home."
"I mean, I can kind of"
"good cause for this intrusion?"
"for advice, actually."
"On your right, pull in."
"my metaphors again, aren't I?"
"Hey, there it go."
"something at my uncle's."
"Who else but a Neoprim"
"We even made a flag for it."
"And by ""good,"" I mean not just,"
"You see,"
"Your Majesty?"
"You're talking about my"
"Another one for Burton, too."
"Will someone please tell me"
"my voice has"
"an outright declaration of war."
"you could call it."
"and Edward my bosses?"
"your affairs in order."

"Follow me."
"Maybe tell him"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
"It's crucial that"
"I didn't..."
