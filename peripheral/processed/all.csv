"What sort of mess"
"have you gotten yourself"
"into now, Aelita?"
"You mean, what sort of mess"
"have you got me into?"
"Who would have ever guessed"
"you'd become the sort of man"
"who makes"
"such dangerous friends?"
"I went for six months"
"without shoes once."
"Remember?"
"Amazing how"
"the soles of one's feet"
"can toughen up or go soft."
"Depends on their environment."
"Just like the other sort"
"of soul."
"Do you remember"
"what happened to them?"
"My shoes?"
"You gave them to me."
"When I first found you,"
"I made a vow."
"That I'd save you if I could."
"And you did."
"Did I?"
"What are you up to, Aelita?"
"Saving a world."
"Our world is long past saving."
"I thought"
"that was always your point."
"I didn't say ""our"" world."
"Goodbye, Wolf."
"Aelita?"
"Aelita?"
"Morning, Mama."
"Mm."
"Brought you some coffee."
"Just be careful."
"It's a little hot."
"Ah. Thank you."
"There you go."
"And I made you a sandwich."
"I left it in the fridge."
"Burton wants one, he can"
"go ahead and make his own."
"He ate yours yesterday."
"And please don't try"
"to tell me otherwise."
"I wasn't hungry."
"Can't keep losing weight, Mama."
"Go end up in the hospital again."
"Burton!"
"sh*t."
"Burton! Open up!"
"Burton."
"Do you care to tell me why"
"Mama's last Tamosene's"
"only ten milligrams?"
"Jump in real quick."
"I got to pee."
"Uh-uh. Have you been"
"swapping pills with Mama?"
"Burton."
"Have you been swapping pills"
"with Mama?"
"Jesus Christ, Flynne."
"You really think I'd do that?"
"She's got a ten milligram pill."
"And just that one, too."
"Which means you've likely"
"not only been swapping"
"but stealing."
"So I need cash. Now."
"How much?"
"How much you got?"
"A thousand, if I make it to the next level."
"Which you could maybe help with."
"That's just one pill."
"Which is one day, ain't it?"
"And I got"
"something big coming tonight."
"So we'll have the rest tomorrow."
"All right. Orient me."
"Squad of Nazis in the house."
"We're in the barn."
"Who's ""we""?"
"Me and Reece"
"and some dude from California."
"He hired us"
"to get him past level 20."
"Keeps saying ""Chill."""
"Annoying as all hell."
"Reece is the one in the beret."
"Hurry up!"
"I'm late enough as it is."
"Whoa, now, hold it, hold it!"
"Jesus, don't y'all"
"even have a shred..."
"...of decency?"
"At least let the damn sheep out."
"I like your beret, Reece."
"Real classy."
"Flynne?"
"Where is Burton?"
"Powdering his nose."
"What are we looking for?"
"Supposed to be a map."
"Did y'all find it?"
"What are you doing?"
"Drag that door open, will ya?"
"I'm back."
"Gimme a sec."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Chill, dude."
"You want to guess why"
"y'all didn't find that map?"
"Why?"
"'Cause it hadn't arrived yet."
"You can send the money"
"to my phone."
"You're welcome."
"Reece!"
"What the f*ck happened?"
"Flynne happened."
"Is it true"
"that Homeland Security"
"flags every withdrawal?"
"Well, that would"
"make sense, I suppose."
"Seems the only time"
"folks use cash nowadays"
"is for something funny."
"Now, is there a question"
"hiding in there somewhere,"
"Tommy?"
"How's your mama doing, Flynne?"
"She's okay."
"Yeah. Thanks for asking."
"What you doing here?"
"Macon and Edward run afoul"
"of the law"
"at long last?"
"Well, not quite yet."
"But, uh, give 'em time."
"I was just"
"dropping off an order for Dee Dee."
"Printing toppers"
"for our, uh, wedding cake."
"Well..."
"I should probably go"
"and help 'em out."
"They'll..."
"definitely mess it up"
"without some adult oversight."
"Well,"
"Billy Ann is waiting on you."
"With some nubbins."
"So you're warned."
"Thank you."
"See ya, Tommy."
"You didn't say"
"anything, did you?"
"Well, what was"
"I supposed to say?"
"How 'bout you go,"
"""Oh, just trying to imagine"
"what it must be like to be you."
"Standing there."""
"Then you go, ""But I can't."
"You're too damn handsome."
"It's like trying"
"to imagine myself"
"inside a lion."""
"Billy, a lion?"
"Doesn't matter."
"Just pick an animal."
"And then,"
"all sultry,"
"""You value your time?"""
"And he says, ""Sure,"""
"'cause what else would he say?"
"And you go, ""Well,"
"why waste these"
"precious minutes talking..."""
"Hey, Flynne?"
"I got Tommy's order here."
"""...when we could be pressing"
"our sweaty..."" Oh, my."
"Have you any idea"
"why they ordered two grooms"
"and only one bride?"
"""Howdy, Billy Ann."
"Mind if I have a nubbin?"""
"Uh, maybe 'cause"
"you misread the form?"
"f*ck."
"All set, then."
"""Great to see you, Billy Ann."
"Thanks for the nubbins."""
"I have to say it:"
"your skills and personality"
"are being sadly wasted"
"in this den of imbecility."
"Printer 15 jammed."
"Especially when you have"
"a far more lucrative"
"employment option"
"at your literal fingertips."
"How much does Burton get"
"jockeying for rich folks?"
"A whole lot more"
"than he deserves."
"And you could earn even more."
"As long as you use"
"his avatar, that is,"
"and they don't realize"
"it's a girl doing it."
"I'm done with that, Billy Ann."
"I've already told you that."
"Yeah, have indeed."
"But not the why of it."
"Which would seem like the meat"
"of that particular sandwich."
"It ain't real."
"Like it or not, this here's"
"the only world that I got."
"Oh."
"Well,"
"on that note..."
"...before I go make the world"
"a cleaner place,"
"I have one last thing"
"to say about this."
"If somebody had been"
"all puppy-eyed for me"
"in the lead-up"
"to my marrying Jasper..."
"...I would've surely wanted"
"to know it."
"'Cause like you just said,"
"life goes by real quick."
"So..."
"why waste a minute being timid?"
"You know that was"
"a whole lot more"
"than just one thing, right?"
"All right."
"Have a good day, sweet pea."
"Maybe do something bold with it"
"and make us all proud, huh?"
"Bye, Billy Ann."
"Bye."
"Hey, ladies."
"f*ck."
"Oh!"
"f*ck me."
"Mm."
"What?"
"Burton said to fetch this home."
"What is it?"
"Just the coolest f*cking thing"
"we've ever fabbed."
"Mm-hmm."
"And how'd he pay for it?"
"Didn't. Something called..."
"""Mi-la-gros Cold iron"" did."
"Covered our overhead for"
"the month in the process, too."
"And what's it supposed to do?"
"So, it's some sort"
"of remote piloting gizmo."
"I mean, our best guess, that is."
"Yep. Half the components"
"don't even have patents yet,"
"far as we can tell."
"It's like mercenary sh*t,"
"my bet."
"Where did this come from?"
"Mi-la-gros"
"Cold iron."
"It's a Colombian company."
"We looked 'em up."
"Mm-hmm. What kind?"
"Kind that's registered"
"in BogotÃ¡."
"And that's all"
"they're gonna tell you,"
"f*ck you very much."
"Is Burton working for a cartel?"
"f*ck off."
"Now, you two are positive"
"he ain't paying nothing"
"for this?"
"Mm-mm. Not a dime."
"You have got to scan for it, though."
"Mm-hmm."
"Wait."
"Seriously?"
"Nothing personal. Customer"
"requested chain of custody."
"You want to talk some sense"
"to me about Mama's pills?"
"Go on."
"I can feel you wanting to."
"What?"
"Ask what this is."
"How old do you think I was"
"the last time that worked on me?"
"Handing me a toy to distract me?"
"Might be surprised."
"'Cause when it is working,"
"you wouldn't necessarily notice."
"That's sort of the whole point."
"It looks weird."
"What are"
"all those silver prongs for?"
"And there's no screen."
"Cutting-edge VR, Flynne."
"Folks want me to beta test it."
"For a sh*tload of money, too."
"Put us in the clear for months."
"Why you?"
"Turns out I'm one"
"of the few jockeys"
"ever to reach the 100th level"
"in Halcyon."
"Come on."
"You never made it past level 83,"
"the fire caves."
"True enough."
"But someone else was using"
"my avatar, apparently."
"Playing as Easy Ice."
"And she got herself"
"all the way to level 107."
"Uh-uh. No, Burton."
"I don't have time for this sh*t."
"I got to put dinner on..."
"This here's the only way"
"we're gonna pay"
"for Mama's Tamosene."
"Come on. You know"
"I'm proud of you, right?"
"How good you are at this?"
"Oh, shut up."
"You are so full of sh*t."
"I can't see how you"
"stand yourself sometimes."
"I know."
"But it's true."
"I am proud of you."
"They pay by level?"
"Time on the clock, straight up."
"Longer you're in,"
"the more you earn."
"Like I said,"
"working out the kinks."
"What do they want?"
"Killer?"
"Achiever and explorer."
"Your fortes."
"Do I get another big-ass beard"
"this time or what?"
"Far as I can tell,"
"you're gonna be a version of me."
"Okay."
"Then I should probably just act"
"a little dimwitted, then."
"I just put it on?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Lay back."
"Close your eyes."
"Stop it."
"Count back from ten."
"The rest should be"
"self-explanatory,"
"more or less."
"Okay."
"Six. Five."
"Four. Three."
"Two. One."
"Burton, this is not working."
"Whoa!"
"Holy sh*t!"
"Well, hello."
"Welcome to the Sim, Easy Ice."
"Is this like your other sims?"
"No. No f*cking way."
"I can feel things."
"Everything."
"Pain, too."
"So you've been warned."
"Who are you?"
"The voice in your head."
"I tell you what to do"
"and you do it."
"That's how you earn your keep."
"Left."
"Your destination."
"I think I know what that is."
"No, you know what it used to be."
"Halfway around the circle."
"Keep going."
"Around the corner."
"And pull up"
"at the door on the left."
"You're on foot from here."
"I need a weapon?"
"Just the rapier of your wit,"
"should you possess such a thing."
"Let's look lively now."
"Someone's waiting."
"Say ""I've arrived."""
"I've arrived."
"You don't appear to be"
"in our database."
"Your name is?"
"Easy Ice."
"And do you prefer ""Easy""?"
"Or ""Mr. Ice""?"
"""Mr. Ice"" has"
"a pretty good ring to it."
"Registered, Mr. Ice."
"Enjoy the party, Mr. Ice."
"Where is everybody?"
"In the garden, dear."
"What is this?"
"A company party."
"Somebody made a sim"
"about a company party"
"at Buckingham Palace?"
"There's the wit"
"I was hoping for."
"What's the company?"
"A little venture called"
"the R.I."
"Which stands for...?"
"Research Institute."
"Or Rebirth and Innovation."
"Or Radically Immoral."
"Depending upon whom you ask."
"This is their annual"
"self-congratulatory"
"pat on the shoulder."
"A high point"
"of the social calendar,"
"I assure you."
"Not to be missed."
"Head inside, please."
"Enjoying yourself, Mr. Ice?"
"Now,"
"shall we play a little game?"
"Mirror, mirror on the wall."
"Who's the prettiest of 'em all?"
"Oh, dear. No, no, no, no, no."
"That's the queen bee"
"of this entire vile hive."
"You don't want to feel"
"her sting, trust me."
"That's better."
"Warmer. Warmer."
"Warmer still."
"Your crown of laurels."
"Now approach her, please."
"I need you to convince this"
"young woman to take you home."
"Don't tell me you're shy."
"Make this happen now"
"or you won't be paid."
"It's flattering at first,"
"you know."
"But if you stare too long,"
"it starts to feel a tad dodgy."
"And..."
"you are about"
"to cross that line."
"I was just trying to imagine"
"what it must be like."
"To be you."
"Sitting here like this."
"And?"
"I can't."
"You're just too beautiful."
"It's like trying"
"to imagine myself inside a..."
"swan."
"Come."
"Sit."
"Be a king to my queen."
"I'm Mariel. And you are?"
"Do you value your time, Mariel?"
"Well, as much as anyone. Why?"
"I could introduce myself"
"and then spend"
"the next hour leaning close,"
"complimenting you."
"And then, maybe,"
"if the signs seemed right,"
"I could ask you to take me home."
"Or?"
"I could ask you now."
"Your new friend"
"has rather affected tastes."
"Her car requires a driver."
"Should you try to harm Mariel,"
"this creature is programmed"
"to kill you, all right?"
"In your pocket,"
"you'll find a glass ampoule."
"You're gonna snap this open,"
"hold it under"
"Mariel's pretty nose,"
"and while you do this,"
"I'd suggest you attend"
"rather closely"
"to your surroundings."
"Chop, chop."
"Let's keep this moving."
"Look at her."
"I speak,"
"and I'm like a thought"
"for you, aren't I?"
"Left."
"Such power."
"I didn't realize I'd enjoy it"
"quite so much."
"Planting words in your head,"
"like so many seeds"
"in fertile soil."
"Left."
"When there were need"
"of the creation of the sun,"
"the Moon, the planets,"
"and the Earth,"
"there was only darkness,"
"and everything was created"
"from the darkness."
"On your right, pull in."
"So..."
"Show us what you've learned."
"I've arrived."
"Who's this?"
"Your master, little puppet."
"The one who pulls your strings."
"What?"
"You're my first polt."
"I'm not gonna lie, it's..."
"bit of an odd feeling."
"What's a polt?"
"You see, I know"
"that you're real,"
"and yet..."
"Still, it's just all a bit"
"hard to fathom."
"If I assured you that"
"you'd likely no longer exist"
"in, like, another decade,"
"what would that mean to you?"
"No, it's true. Ten years."
"Would that carry any weight?"
"Would you wake from here"
"and change your life?"
"You were easier to follow"
"when you were just"
"a voice inside my head."
"Mm."
"Now what?"
"Something rather eye-opening,"
"I assure you."
"Let's resume this tomorrow,"
"shall we?"
"Well, you gonna"
"say something, or just lie there?"
"Holy sh*t."
"Holy sh*t. It was"
"like being there."
"Like I was actually"
"in your body."
"Felt like an upgrade, I bet."
"No, it felt f*cking weird"
"is what it felt like."
"What's the sim about?"
"A kidnapping."
"But, I mean, that's definitely"
"just the start."
"Well, you must've done"
"something right"
"because they want you"
"back tomorrow,"
"and they just bumped up the money."
"No sh*t."
"Look, I don't want to be"
"an asshole about this, Flynne,"
"but we're talking"
"a lot of f*cking cash here."
"Like, enough to set us right"
"for months."
"I hear you."
"And?"
"There's no need to argue."
"It's that good, huh?"
"Hell, if you had any idea,"
"you'd for sure want"
"to take over yourself."
"Wh-Wh-Whoa. Hold up."
"You good?"
"Yeah."
"Is that thing safe?"
"Bit late to ask now,"
"don't you think?"
"How's it work?"
"I don't know. Some sort"
"of neural cutout, I guess."
"Like my haptics."
"Ah, f*ck. Well, that"
"ended up pretty well, huh?"
"Just wait here till it passes."
"You'll be fine."
"I'll ride over to Jimmy's"
"and pick up the rest"
"of Mama's Tamosene."
"Nah, I got it, Burton."
"I could use some fresh air."
"Sorry, Conner."
"I've been told to cut you off."
"I need Tamosene."
"Think you might need a little"
"bit of help with your math"
"here, Flynne."
"I just want the one pill."
"I'll come back here tomorrow"
"and pick up the rest."
"You know that's not"
"how this works."
"Y'all shut the f*ck up."
"Now, unless you want to,"
"uh..."
"I don't know, figure out"
"some sort of barter deal?"
"You know,"
"render us both a service?"
"Atticus,"
"give me the goddamn pill."
"Maybe you should try"
"your luck at Pharma Jon."
"See if they're a little more..."
"...amenable."
"Gentlemen."
"How about you just give"
"the young lady"
"what she asking for?"
"I would've guessed"
"a one-armed dude"
"would know when it's time"
"to mind his own business."
"Want to know the best part"
"about being"
"a one-armed dude, Cash?"
"No more clapping?"
"You ain't got"
"a lot left to lose, bruh."
"Walk away."
"Why? Are you worried"
"about your boyfriend?"
"I'm worried about you."
"You see,"
"in a situation like this?"
"Now, let's say I decide"
"to reach for that"
"bull pup there."
"Now, what's the worst thing"
"that can happen to me?"
"As far as I can figure,"
"the worst thing,"
"and I mean"
"the very f*cking worst..."
"...is that I only"
"manage to kill two of you,"
"rather than all three."
"They should've"
"finished the job, Conner."
"Killed you outright."
"Done us all a service."
"Yeah. Trust me, Cash."
"I had the same thought,"
"many a morning."
"Gonna rob a bank tomorrow?"
"Nah, Burton has"
"something he scrounged up."
"Knowing him as I do,"
"that sounds a tad worrisome."
"Mm-hmm."
"How's he holding up?"
"You should come by sometime."
"See for yourself. He might even"
"be moved enough"
"to offer you a beer."
"Just the one?"
"Well, I guess it depends"
"on how generous"
"he's feeling."
"How's the charge on that?"
"Low."
"Burton never pedals"
"like he ought to."
"Those words could end up"
"on his gravestone one day,"
"don't you think?"
"Definitely, yeah."
"Want some help with it?"
"See you around, Conner."
"I think a quick"
"performance review"
"might be in order,"
"don't you?"
"Some constructive criticism?"
"I-I could understand"
"how you might be"
"unhappy with us, Mr. Pickett."
"Gonna hit the john real quick."
"Sit down, Jasper."
"I'm not unhappy."
"Just confused."
"If you'd decided to sell"
"that young woman one pill,"
"I might be inclined to trust"
"you made a judgment call."
"I might even respect it."
"Betraying, as it would,"
"an unexpected level"
"of improvisational thinking."
"But..."
"...it's the bullying"
"that gives me pause."
"Bullying?"
"Well, what would you call it?"
"The way that drunk cripple"
"manhandled you out there?"
"Drink up, son."
"I need you calm,"
"so you can absorb this lesson."
"When you look weak,"
"I look weak."
"Understand?"
"Good boy."
"Take him to"
"the restroom, Jasper."
"Get him cleaned up."
"Something wrong, hon?"
"No, ma'am. Just the sorry state"
"of your hair."
"But don't worry, I'll ask"
"Billy Ann to come over"
"and give this briar patch"
"a little trim."
"That'd be nice."
"She tells me all the news"
"you're too proper to share."
"Are you trying to call"
"Billy Ann a gossip?"
"I'm saying she knows how"
"to entertain"
"an old shut-in like me."
"Is her Jasper still mixed up"
"with his Uncle Corbell?"
"Mama, please tell me"
"that you do not ask her that."
"If I was her best friend,"
"I might."
"So, how's the pain been?"
"Oh... you know."
"I don't."
"That's precisely why I'm asking."
"Well, Burton's been"
"giving me his extra pills."
"That's helped some."
"What do you mean?"
"Well, he says he doesn't"
"need them so much anymore."
"They help tide me through"
"the rough patches."
"How are those"
"haptics treating you?"
"Been worse."
"I saw you last night."
"Through the window."
"Appreciate the beers."
"Could've been colder, though."
"Beggars and choosers, Burton."
"I'm sorry I said"
"all that evil stuff"
"about you taking Mama's pills."
"Hey, you know"
"if you ever want to talk,"
"I'm all ears."
"About what?"
"You know, the pain."
"What's going on, Flynne?"
"What do you mean?"
"You're acting f*cking weird."
"Yeah? Well, just give me that."
"Stop piddlin' with it."
"I promise not to tell anyone,"
"but you almost look happy there."
"Makes me want to take a photo."
"Record the event"
"for posterity's sake."
"f*ck off."
"Just don't let Milagros Cold iron"
"catch you smiling like that."
"They might start charging us,"
"rather than paying."
"They got a good thing going"
"here, Burton. I'm telling you."
"It's gonna be huge."
"Well, enjoy it while you can."
"I intend to."
"Don't you worry about that."
"Six. Five."
"Four. Three."
"Two. One."
"I assume you're wondering"
"why you can't move."
"And that's a very good question."
"Which leads to"
"another question, I know."
"Why would I do such a thing?"
"Do you know"
"what ""enucleation"" means?"
"Hmm?"
"Now, I imagine that you've begun"
"to shout in your head,"
"haven't you?"
"""End game! Disconnect!"""
"Alas, you can't"
"do that here, 'cause"
"I initiated the connection,"
"and only I can end it, so..."
"Oh, look."
"That's Mariel's"
"beautiful blue orb."
"Soon to be yours."
"Okay,"
"I suppose that this"
"may all seem"
"a little bit sadistic."
"Me not putting you under"
"and all that, but"
"I assure you,"
"it's for a very noble cause,"
"all right? Look,"
"I may need you"
"to endure terrible pain"
"in the coming hours,"
"okay? So try"
"and see this as"
"a sort of little test."
"I mean, you're not actually"
"in this body, are you?"
"Can you hear your heart?"
"It's like a frightened horse,"
"trapped in a burning barn."
"But none of this is real, is it?"
"I need you"
"to discipline your mind."
"Convince it that this is"
"all imaginary."
"Your heart."
"Show me that you can rein it in."
"Well done."
"Very well done."
"I think you've earned yourself"
"a little shut-eye,"
"so to speak, don't you?"
"Back, are we?"
"And look how pretty you are."
"Ah-ah, ah-ah. Best not."
"Doctor's orders."
"What are we doing?"
"You're going to be a love,"
"and open some doors for me."
"Press your eye to it,"
"or rather dear Mariel's."
"What is this place?"
"""Infinity in the palm"
"of your hand."
"Eternity in an hour."""
"It's a great gift"
"I'm giving you."
"I hope you're worthy of it."
"Are you ready?"
"For what?"
"To lay claim to your destiny."
"Your eye."
"The other one."
"Master it."
"Ooh."
"Stop him."
"Now. He's here to kill us."
"Aelita West."
"Grains and Legumes."
"Have you encountered"
"one of these before?"
"It's a clever little device."
"Delivers a sonic punch."
"Right down into the organs."
"Now, I've never felt it myself,"
"but what I've observed,"
"it's rather effective."
"Who else is involved?"
"f*ck you."
"Is this the liver over here?"
"Or is it the spleen?"
"I really should brush up on my anatomy."
"But I know where the brain is."
"And guess what happens then?"
"Names, Ms. West."
"Who else is helping you?"
"Help? I f*cking wish."
"Run!"
"Easy Ice, eh?"
"Brilliant."
"What's your real name, lad?"
"Once we cut this"
"bloody thing's head off,"
"we can easily trace"
"your connection."
"So why draw it out?"
"Who are you?"
"Where are you?"
"What happened?"
"Never again."
"What..."
"Never f*cking again."
"Flynne!"
"Flynne Harlene Fisher."
"I've been waiting out"
"in Jasper's truck,"
"thinking you were tied up"
"tending to your mama."
"Finally, I decided"
"I ought to come in"
"and lend a hand,"
"being such a conscientious"
"friend and all,"
"and look what I find."
"Shake a leg, princess."
"Mm-mm."
"I'm calling in sick."
"What's wrong?"
"Everything."
"Know what dÃ©jÃ  vu means"
"if you translate it,"
"like, literally?"
"""Already seen."""
"As in, we both already seen"
"how this sort of funk"
"plays out"
"'cause we been here before."
"This exact same moment,"
"so come on,"
"get some clothes on."
"You didn't."
"Billy Ann, drop it."
"Billy Ann, give it back."
"You dirty, dirty girl."
"Give it back."
"Billy Ann, give me the figurine."
"Stop."
"Think I might've missed"
"an episode or two here."
"Mind catching me up?"
"Just go."
"All right?"
"Jasper's waiting on you."
"And he'll keep at it, too."
"Which is one of his finer"
"qualities, if I'm being honest."
"What? Is this about Tommy?"
"That's just so stupid."
"What's so stupid about it?"
"It's a seventh-grade crush"
"I didn't have any good sense"
"to give up on. That's what."
"Act on, you mean."
"Come on, Billy Ann."
"It ain't gonna happen."
"You know that."
"You know, I've been"
"playing this sim,"
"filling in for Burton."
"Mean, it's"
"new tech, best I've ever seen."
"It's like you're..."
"actually there."
"You can feel your whole body,"
"like it's real or something."
"Hmm."
"Then, you know,"
"just 'cause people want to go"
"and make things nasty,"
"it turned."
"They cut my eye out."
"Mm-mm."
"Beat me to death,"
"for no reason at all."
"It was just meanness,"
"plain and simple."
"I'm sorry, sweet pea."
"Yeah, but you know, the thing"
"that I keep thinking on..."
"The palm of my hand"
"got ripped off, right?"
"Oh, Jesus."
"Yeah, but underneath it,"
"it was..."
"...it was a machine."
"Why would they design it"
"like that?"
"Why not?"
"'Cause it seems to me like"
"the whole thing they're gonna"
"be selling this sim on,"
"what's most important about it,"
"is that everything feels real."
"So why go and put machine"
"underneath it?"
"Why not just use"
"an actual human hand?"
"I don't think I'm following."
"I'm just being stupid."
"I know that look"
"you get, Flynne."
"Might mean a lot"
"of different things,"
"but stupid ain't one."
"f*ck it. Then here it is."
"I can't help but think"
"that I was..."
"actually there."
"In a real body,"
"somewhere that's... real."
"Not just in an another sim."
"Ms. Fisher,"
"I need you to listen"
"very closely."
"You're in grave danger."
"Everything you believe"
"about your experience"
"with the headset is wrong."
"Everything. The situation"
"is far more complex"
"and far more perilous"
"than you can possibly imagine."
"It's crucial that you log back"
"into the sim. Immediately."
"How'd you get this number?"
"Ms. Fisher?"
"I asked you a question."
"Finding your number"
"has honestly been"
"the least challenging"
"of my tasks."
"Well, don't call it again."
"Your life is at risk."
"f*ck."
"...Atlanta couple had"
"two servings"
"of bad luck yesterday,"
"when a bee flew in"
"their car window."
"The driver..."
"...in a panic,"
"sending the car swerving"
"into a tree..."
"...the driver was unconscious..."
"so police were called to the scene."
"Step into the road, please."
"Why?"
"I'm gonna shoot you"
"if you don't."
"What?"
"It's of critical importance"
"that you sign back"
"into the sim, Ms. Fisher."
"Immediately."
"You are in grave danger."
"An ad has been posted"
"on the dark net offering"
"a $9 million bounty"
"for a contract killing."
"There's reason to..."
"There's reason to believe"
"that you and your family"
"are the intended target."
"The offer has been accepted..."
"The offer has been..."
"The offer has been accepted by a party..."
"The offer has been accepted"
"by a party out of Memphis."
"I cannot assist you"
"in this emergency"
"unless you sign back in."
"I repeat. I cannot"
"assist you"
"in this emergency unless"
"you sign back in."
"Thing is,"
"one of these nights, Conner's"
"gonna roll out of Jimmy's"
"sh*t-faced again, and..."
"he ain't gonna make it home."
"And that's on all of us."
"Even if it's the one thing"
"we've all somehow agreed"
"never to f*cking talk about."
"How we had intel"
"on that situation."
"The one that got him"
"all blown up."
"We all let him choose"
"not to pay it any mind."
"Yeah, well..."
"...it felt a little"
"more complicated"
"than that, at the time."
"Burton!"
"Hey, Flynne."
"What's going on?"
"The mighty Flynne."
"Someone from that company's"
"trying to contact me."
"What company?"
"Milagros whatever,"
"the Colombian one."
"He said someone put a hit on us"
"for $9 million on the dark net."
"f*ck off. Y'all can laugh,"
"but he went a fair ways if he"
"was just trying to freak me out."
"Did he say why?"
"No, he didn't say why. He said"
"I just need to sign in again,"
"so he can help us."
"He's just trying to get you"
"back in the harness."
"I'll call him tomorrow,"
"tell him to f*ck off."
"Why not tonight?"
"'Cause I've got company, Flynne."
"And he's maybe a little"
"too drunk to find his phone."
"Hey, grab that 12-pack"
"from the fridge, would you?"
"You're too drunk to fetch it,"
"you're too drunk to drink it."
"What's she talking about?"
"Sim developer."
"Hired me to do a job."
"Hired your avatar, that is."
"Meaning Flynne."
"Whatever's on your mind,"
"might as well go ahead"
"and say it."
"Conner."
"What about him?"
"What we were just talking about."
"His current state."
"How we all had warning"
"and chose not to believe it."
"Like..."
"a $9 million bounty."
"Are you serious?"
"Still got those drones"
"in your car?"
"Tommy Constantine was"
"asking after you the other day."
"Funny thing"
"about losing your sight?"
"People get frozen in your mind."
"I know I've seen Tommy"
"all grown up."
"And I ought to be able"
"to picture him that way,"
"but you say his name,"
"and I just see"
"a scrawny little boy."
"Him and Burton and the others"
"on their bikes, racing down"
"that hill out front."
"That was a long time ago, Mama."
"What are they up to out there?"
"Playing with their"
"stupid drones."
"None of them managed"
"to grow up, far as I can tell."
"Not many do, in my experience."
"Sleeping pill?"
"Yes, please."
"Ah."
"All right, Mama."
"Mm."
"Night night."
"Night. Love you."
"Love you."
"There something"
"I ought to know about?"
"Just an excess of caution."
"Here."
"You got anything?"
"No, not yet."
"We were wondering, Flynne,"
"you sure they didn't mean"
"nine dollars?"
"Whoa."
"You f*cking with us?"
"Looks like"
"somebody's come hunting"
"for that nine dollars."
"What happens"
"when more people come?"
"Hunting us down?"
"I could really use some intel"
"right about now."
"You're inside"
"what we call a Peripheral."
"Telepresent."
"Piloting that body"
"as if it were your own."
"I just don't believe you."
"A lot can happen"
"in 70 years, Ms. Fisher."
"A lot did happen."
"Those men who came to kill you?"
"They won't be the last."
"Eliminate Flynne"
"and Burton Fisher."
"This here's"
"the only world that I got."
"What is it?"
"Cutting-edge VR, Flynne."
"Folks want me to beta test it."
"Well, hello."
"Welcome to the Sim, Easy Ice."
"Are you ready?"
"Holy sh*t."
"I can't help but think"
"that I was actually there."
"Somewhere that's real."
"Ms. Fisher,"
"you're in grave danger."
"The situation is"
"far more complex"
"than you can possibly imagine."
"It's crucial that"
"you log back into the sim."
"I may need you to endure"
"terrible pain"
"in the coming hours."
"I assure you it's for"
"a very noble cause, all right?"
"Someone from that company's"
"trying to contact me."
"He says someone"
"put a hit out on us."
"For $9 million on the dark net."
"A breach of this"
"magnitude puts all of us here"
"at the Research Institute"
"in profound peril."
"You've disappointed me, Daniel."
"Yes, Doctor."
"We traced the operator."
"His location and temporality"
"complicate the situation,"
"of course."
"But we've taken"
"the necessary steps"
"to eliminate the threat."
"Those being?"
"We've put up a posting"
"on something called"
"the dark web."
"It's a..."
"Yes, I know what it is."
"Has the offer been accepted?"
"Almost immediately."
"By a reliable party?"
"Ex-military. Elite unit."
"We'll be providing"
"some assistance"
"on the technical side."
"Well, it's not just him"
"that we need dead."
"It's anyone even remotely"
"associated with him."
"Well, the posting"
"was quite explicit"
"in this regard, ma'am."
"Scorched earth."
"Drone inbound."
"Get Mama in the basement."
"Can you hack it?"
"I need a bunch of dumb-ass"
"drunks around the fire."
"Not much motion."
"Get it done, Reece,"
"or we go without it."
"Mama!"
"Done. Link me."
"These sorry"
"motherf*ckers have no idea"
"who they just picked"
"a fight with."
"Linked."
"Linked."
"Linked."
"Okay."
"You've got your long guns?"
"Mama. Mama. Wake up."
"Mama, wake up right now."
"Mama, wake up!"
"Mama, get up."
"Stay down!"
"Back up, back up!"
"Where is it?"
"f*ck. Come on, f*cker."
"Come on."
"Stop!"
"Drop your f*cking gun now!"
"Mama?"
"It's all right."
"She slept through the whole thing."
"Problem."
"Only seeing ten bodies."
"One's in the house."
"Counted."
"Still two missing."
"Play it back."
"LMG team."
"They hacked us back."
"Motherf*cker!"
"One's on the move!"
"Low on ammo here."
"Here, too."
"Ain't about to be"
"running up that ridge,"
"if that's what you're thinking."
"Not asking you to."
"Burton!"
"Who is that?"
"Will someone please tell me"
"what the f*ck is going on?"
"Your little sister said"
"I should stop by for a beer."
"She ain't say nothin' about you"
"throwing such"
"a fun party, though."
"Aelita."
"Aelita."
"I thought that was you."
"What are the chances?"
"You're pretending, Wolf."
"Why would you say that?"
"You have two choices."
"You can tell me the truth,"
"why you've tracked me down,"
"or you can f*ck off"
"back up the street."
"I know a person who's looking"
"for some information"
"about your current"
"place of employment."
"The Research Institute?"
"And this person you know,"
"he's a fool, is he?"
"As far as I can see,"
"there's three possible"
"categories at play."
"Fool. Klept. Maybe the Met..."
"He's not a fool."
"So a klept, then."
"Now why would I want"
"to get entangled"
"with such an unpalatable world?"
"There would be"
"a sum of money involved"
"that will carry you"
"far beyond the level of need."
"I don't want money."
"Are you happy, Aelita?"
"Every morning..."
"Don't you f*cking dare do that."
"...I'd ask you,"
"""Are you happy?"""
"And every time,"
"you'd give me the same answer."
"Despite all that was going on,"
"the desolation all around us."
"""Yes."" ""Yes."""
"""Yes."""
"Do you still wake up like that?"
"So this is altruism, is it?"
"Is there a finder's fee"
"for the Good Samaritan?"
"Both can exist, can't they?"
"Self-interest and altruism?"
"I'm quite serious."
"You really don't"
"seem happy to me."
"The individual you know,"
"his overture, or whatever"
"you want to call it,"
"it's gonna make me happy, is it?"
"A little bit of intrigue,"
"to liven up your days."
"Where's the harm in that?"
"Hello?"
"Good God, Wilf,"
"you sound like hell."
"The hour may have something"
"to do with that, Lev."
"Which should give a sense"
"of the urgency at play."
"What's going on?"
"I've sent a car."
"It's waiting downstairs."
"It's 5:00"
"in the f*cking morning."
"I'm not going anywhere."
"I pay you a retainer,"
"quite a generous one"
"if I'm not mistaken."
"Given what I understand"
"to be the going rate for..."
"um, what is it you call"
"yourself again, Wilf?"
"A ""fixer""?"
"I do admire the brute"
"simplicity of the title."
"All I'm asking"
"is that you do your job."
"Fix a problem of mine,"
"and fix it now."
"The bounty"
"on the girl and her family,"
"someone tried to claim it."
"Or to be more precise,"
"a team of someones."
"And rather violently."
"We got lucky,"
"but our good fortune"
"isn't likely to last."
"So my technicals have built"
"the girl a Peripheral."
"I need you to get her"
"inside it now."
"She's our best chance"
"of finding Aelita."
"I can sense your glare"
"of disapproval, Ash."
"What is it now?"
"Your friend, Mr. Netherton."
"I worry your personal attachment"
"might be affecting"
"your judgment."
"That he's not"
"the right man for the job."
"Because...?"
"He's the sort you pay to carry"
"a bag of money to someone,"
"isn't he?"
"Slippery. Unmemorable."
"The type authorities"
"overlook because"
"he's not like you."
"He's not a..."
"A wealthy bon vivant?"
"A descendant of an illustrious"
"Russian bloodline?"
"A patron to the arts?"
"A killer."
"He's just a pet."
"Obliging and sweet."
"And the current situation"
"may require us"
"to be a little bit more..."
"Brutal?"
"One day I'll share with you"
"how I first met Wilf."
"He doesn't like"
"to talk about it."
"Quite modest, really."
"But let's just say,"
"when it comes to"
"his capacity for violence,"
"he is one of the family."
"Especially when"
"properly motivated."
"And no one could possibly"
"be more motivated"
"to find Aelita"
"than Wilf Netherton."
"I'm sorry, Flynne."
"I know this is the last thing"
"you want to do,"
"but we need the intel."
"If you'd like it altered"
"in any way,"
"we can easily accommodate you."
"I'm Wilf Netherton."
"I'll be as direct as possible,"
"since neither of us"
"has time for anything else."
"I'm trying to find a woman."
"Aelita West."
"If I'm not mistaken,"
"you might be the last person"
"to have seen her."
"You see, I'm thinking"
"you should probably tell me"
"why people are trying to come"
"and kill me and my family first."
"And then, maybe I'll go and play"
"your stupid missing-lady sim."
"You aren't playing a sim,"
"Ms. Fisher."
"You're inside what we"
"call a Peripheral."
"Telepresent."
"Piloting that body"
"as if it were your own."
"And all this, it..."
"Let me show you."
"This ain't London."
"Why would you say that?"
"Where are all the people?"
"Well, that's where things"
"begin to get a bit tricky."
"This is London."
"But London 70 years from what"
"you think of as the present."
"I'm sorry, you really just"
"expect me to swallow that?"
"That I've time traveled here?"
"To future London?"
"No."
"Not at all."
"If it were time travel,"
"as you say,"
"you'd be here physically."
"This is merely a matter"
"of data transfer."
"Quantum tunneling is"
"the technical term for it."
"It's..."
"I understand your confusion."
"No, I'm not confused at all,"
"actually."
"I just don't believe you."
"You'd like my bona fides?"
"Your mother."
"She has a brain tumor."
"A glioma."
"Okay. You don't really need"
"to be from the future"
"to know that one."
"It's going to kill her in four weeks."
"On September the 22nd."
"Late in the evening."
"That's not true."
"Doctor told her"
"it won't do her in."
"They said there's plenty of"
"stuff in line ahead of that."
"Has her pain been intensifying?"
"That's usually the first sign."
"We've developed a drug"
"to treat gliomas."
"Rather easily."
"It's like spraying a weed,"
"more or less."
"I've sent the formula"
"to your pharmacy."
"They're printing it now."
"We can't afford Pharma Jon."
"We wired payment"
"direct to the pharmacy."
"Think on it, Ms. Fisher."
"But with alacrity."
"The situation is urgent."
"I can't stress that enough."
"You and your family..."
"You remain in grave danger."
"Those men who came to kill you,"
"they won't be the last."
"You need my help to stop them."
"And I'll need yours in turn."
"I'll see you soon."
"Burying and burning have both"
"come up for discussion."
"Along with"
"the straight and narrow approach"
"of contacting"
"the sheriff's office."
"I thought we should"
"hear from you"
"before we committed ourselves."
"Bury them."
"I'm headed into town."
"What for?"
"Tell you when I get back."
"You can't go alone."
"Fine."
"Then send somebody."
"You want to tell me"
"something, Mama?"
"About what?"
"About your glioma?"
"Oh, sweetie."
"Who told you?"
"I'm sorry, Flynne."
"I'm so sorry."
"They tell you"
"something like that..."
"Mama..."
"It sounds silly."
"But suddenly, you realize"
"how precious each day is."
"And the idea of stealing"
"even one second from you,"
"of... of weighing you down"
"with sadness,"
"when I could protect you?"
"How long?"
"Six weeks..."
"...if I'm lucky."
"I told the nurse,"
"if I was lucky,"
"I wouldn't be here"
"in the first place, would I?"
"This new drug, it's..."
"It's experimental."
"We don't know what's in it."
"What's the worst"
"it could do, Flynne?"
"Kill me a little quicker?"
"Come on."
"Okay."
"f*cking A."
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Coffee is on the desk."
"Thanks."
"I could really use some intel"
"right about now,"
"if you got it."
"You're not gonna believe me."
"Try me."
"It ain't a sim."
"When I put on the headset,"
"I'm operating an actual body."
"It's some kind of robot,"
"I guess,"
"but a whole lot"
"more realistic than that."
"It looks like me."
"Feels like me."
"Except it's, uh, in London."
"This guy says."
"I can believe that."
"Well, that ain't"
"the hard part yet."
"He says I witnessed something"
"while I was there."
"Something that these folks"
"are wanting to kill me"
"to keep quiet."
"I still don't see"
"what's so hard to believe."
"It's in the future, Burton."
"Where he is."
"2100."
"I assume he gave you"
"a reason to believe that?"
"You check on Mama"
"on your way up?"
"Is she okay?"
"Claims she's fine."
"But Leon says her vitals"
"are out of whack."
"Like she's fighting something."
"Why?"
"This guy, he-he gave me"
"something for her."
"A drug."
"For her tumor."
"He says it will cure her."
"Well, f*ck that, 'cause we're"
"not taking his word on anything."
"I gave it to her."
"You what?"
"He showed me her obituary, okay?"
"Flynne, you can't"
"just give her..."
"She's gonna die in four weeks"
"if we don't do nothing about it."
"And you just believed that?"
"It was real, Burton."
"It felt real."
"Felt real?"
"Flynne, are you out of your f*cking mind?"
"I'll go back."
"I'll get more intel, if that's what you want."
"No f*cking way."
"I'm going in there."
"No."
"He doesn't want you."
"Okay? He wants me."
"I don't give a f*ck"
"who he wants."
"That's part of the problem."
"You're letting him think"
"he's in charge."
"Goddamn it, Burton."
"Why do you have to go"
"and f*ck things up"
"all the time, huh?"
"f*ck. Look, I'm sorry."
"Okay?"
"We need you here."
"You know that."
"What happens when more people"
"come hunting us down?"
"But I'm going, Burton."
"This ain't a discussion."
"Okay?"
"Welcome back."
"Where are we?"
"The rear garden of a house"
"in Notting Hill."
"It belongs to Lev Zubov."
"That's him, in the waistcoat."
"Are those...?"
"Thylacine analogs."
"Though I believe"
"you might call them"
"something else."
"Tasmanian tigers."
"I saw them on a show once,"
"but they said that"
"they were extinct."
"Well, one of Lev's hobbies"
"is recreating such things."
"From their DNA."
"Do they bite?"
"These two are designed"
"for domestic companionship."
"There's a rival genetic line,"
"bred to be feral."
"So, why are we here?"
"We're in Notting Hill to meet"
"with Lev and his two technicals."
"More specifically,"
"we're in his garden"
"to give you"
"a moment to acclimate"
"before we begin."
"Begin what?"
"Debriefing you."
"Lev is the man"
"who hired me to find Aelita."
"The woman who went missing."
"And what's a technical?"
"Someone with expertise"
"in, ah... technical matters?"
"Gift for words, hasn't he?"
"Ossian is the gentleman"
"looming rather threateningly"
"against the tree."
"He has a knack"
"for that sort of thing,"
"as you'll soon see."
"And Ash is the exceedingly"
"gloomy-looking young woman"
"at the table."
"They work to maintain"
"the connection"
"between our two worlds."
"Which is apparently"
"rather more tenuous"
"than one might prefer."
"Can we bring them in before he"
"says something we can't unsay?"
"Lunch is served, Wilf."
"You can shut it down."
"What happens to this thing"
"when I'm not in it?"
"It has an eight-hour"
"sleep cycle."
"The rest of the time,"
"when you're off in your stub,"
"it runs on AI."
"My ""stub""?"
"When a party from our present"
"made contact with the past,"
"that past immediately"
"branched off"
"and formed its own continuum."
"Or parallel timeline,"
"if you will."
"Or stub."
"In other words,"
"our two time lines were identical"
"until that moment of contact."
"At that point, they separated."
"You're not helping at all."
"Any moment"
"you'd like to jump in."
"It can all be rather"
"confusing, even for us."
"Perhaps we should stick to"
"the most urgent matters at hand,"
"and trust that the secondary"
"details will fall into place."
"Urgent, like the people coming"
"to kill me and my family?"
"For instance."
"Or, from our perspective,"
"urgent being what happened"
"to Aelita West."
"Why is she"
"so important to y'all?"
"Aelita worked for an entity"
"called the Research Institute."
"Her duties there gave her"
"access to your stub."
"We've been paying her to provide"
"us with a trapdoor into it."
"Now that she's missing,"
"we risk losing that connection."
"Mm-hmm."
"Well, what were you all up to"
"in my world, then?"
"I'm sorry?"
"Seems like you're going"
"to an awful lot of trouble"
"here to find things out."
"Kind of just begs"
"the question: Why?"
"You could call it"
"intellectual curiosity."
"Like a game?"
"Like you're playing a sim?"
"I suppose that analogy"
"could be made."
"So, we aren't real to y'all?"
"Are we? Me, my family,"
"my friends."
"Are we real to you?"
"I'm working on it."
"Got a visitor."
"Tommy Constantine."
"On foot."
"Half a klick up the road."
"Bring the drones in."
"Pull back. I'm coming up."
"Roger that."
"Carlos, I need you to cover for me."
"On my way."
"What do I do?"
"Just sit and watch."
"If she wakes, don't tell her"
"where I've got to."
"I ain't gonna lie"
"to her, Burton."
"I'm not asking you to."
"Just tell her I'm walking"
"the perimeter."
"And then try your best"
"to keep her there."
"That drug you gave my mother,"
"all it's gone and done"
"is make her sicker."
"It will accomplish"
"what I promised, I assure you."
"Give it time."
"Which is the one thing"
"she don't have, ain't it?"
"According to y'all?"
"How'd you all get"
"that information, anyway?"
"What else do you all have?"
"You got her obituary."
"But... what happens to me?"
"Well, as we explained before,"
"when someone from our world"
"made contact with yours,"
"your timeline..."
"Yeah, I get it. That's the whole stub thing."
"But what happened to the"
"Flynne Fisher in your timeline?"
"I mean, does she get married,"
"or have any kids?"
"Or is she still alive?"
"What about my brother?"
"There's"
"information to a certain point."
"But after that point, the"
"records become rather spotty."
"What point? Why?"
"A lot can happen"
"in 70 years, Ms. Fisher."
"A lot did happen."
"Yeah, but what? Specifically."
"I fear we're getting"
"a little off track here."
"What are you all hiding from me?"
"These are all"
"excellent questions,"
"and in time,"
"they'll all be answered."
"I give you my word."
"Yeah, you keep on saying that,"
"but it's just starting to sound"
"like it don't mean that much."
"Ms. Fisher..."
"When will my mother get better?"
"Iesniegt navised maehad."
"Urtew cept zoryin."
"They can encrypt their voices"
"when they address each other."
"You'll grow accustomed to it."
"Although,"
"I'm afraid the irritation"
"never quite dissipates."
"I was simply informing Ash"
"that the medication in question"
"has a 57% efficacy rate."
"Which means?"
"The ability to produce"
"a desired or intended result."
"Borrowed from Latin ""efficacia."""
"I know what"
"the f*cking word means."
"What does it mean for my mother?"
"We can't guarantee"
"that the drug will work."
"Well, I'm guessing"
"""spraying a weed"" means"
"something pretty different"
"in the future, huh?"
"Y'all got extinct animals"
"you've brought back to life,"
"time travel, moving tattoos..."
"Seems like it shouldn't be"
"too hard to help a good woman"
"who's had a sh*tty"
"run of luck lately."
"Make that happen..."
"...and I'll start talking"
"about your missing lady."
"Give you my word on it, too."
"You ever come across"
"anything like this?"
"You know what?"
"That's a 6.8 SPC."
"We used those"
"in the war on occasion."
"Builder muscle, you think?"
"Good a guess as any."
"All the way out here, though?"
"That seem a bit odd, don't it?"
"Whole damn thing seems"
"pretty odd to me, Tommy."
"Hey, you and Flynne ain't mad"
"at Dee Dee and me, are you?"
"Why would we be mad?"
"All them vehicles."
"Looks like y'all getting ready"
"to roast a pig or something."
"Just, uh, wondering why"
"we didn't get an invite."
"That's Reece's truck there,"
"right?"
"And Leon?"
"Carlos, too?"
"Yeah, just one of our"
"stupid drone tournaments."
"I didn't figure"
"you'd be fool enough"
"to mess around with those."
"No."
"Suppose not."
"Flynne."
"Burton."
"f*ck."
"I know how personally invested"
"you are here, Wilf."
"So I worry that you might feel"
"an understandable instinct"
"to push the pace a little"
"with Ms. Fisher."
"I think we should"
"let her find her feet"
"before we pressure her too much."
"You said time was a resource"
"we can't afford to waste."
"And I wouldn't"
"consider it wasted"
"if it were time spent"
"making her more..."
"tractable."
"My understanding was"
"that you simply wanted"
"to speak with Aelita."
"It's the only reason I agreed"
"to arrange an introduction."
"Indeed."
"And those conversations"
"led to the possibility"
"of access to this"
"young woman's world."
"Why did you want access?"
"Wilf."
"You've always struck me"
"as someone with a gift for"
"discerning the difference"
"between good knowledge"
"and bad knowledge."
"Good being that which"
"brings you power or advantage."
"Bad being the type which"
"might put you in mortal peril."
"It's a point of pride."
"I don't lie to my friends."
"So, please, take some care"
"of what you ask."
"I'd hate to stop"
"thinking of you as a friend."
"Make sure to say hi"
"to Flynne and your mama for me."
"Yeah, I'll do that, Tommy."
"What did he say?"
"Two abandoned SUVs"
"up the road a ways."
"With some new kind of"
"cloaking tech."
"Which answers that question."
"You okay?"
"I don't f*cking know, Burton."
"I mean, how the f*ck is all"
"this happening right now?"
"There's a pile of dead"
"bodies back there."
"You can't think like that."
"Your buddies from the future"
"gonna help us any?"
"Or we on our own?"
"They said they're watching."
"I guess they'll try"
"to give us a warning"
"before the next wave hits."
"How much of a warning?"
"Much as they can manage."
"They said they're"
"sending money, though."
"A lot."
"$250,000."
"Soon as that hits my account,"
"I'm gonna lose"
"my social security."
"Yeah, I know."
"Don't worry, I told them."
"They said they're gonna"
"figure out a workaround."
"Which is?"
"Holy sh*t."
"Holy f*cking sh*t."
"I just won the goddamn lottery!"
"Oh!"
"I've always been lucky."
"You both know that, don't you?"
"Luck ain't got nothing"
"to do with it, Leon."
"What? You two meet"
"some folks in the futur..."
"Indoor voice, Leon."
"The future?"
"They help me win the lottery?"
"How else you gonna"
"explain that but luck?"
"Leon."
"From Mr. Pickett."
"With his congratulations."
"Corbell Pickett?"
"For real?"
"Mm-hmm. Yep."
"Jesus f*ckin' Christ."
"Just raise your glass."
"Nod your thanks."
"Manners, Flynne."
"I... I just got to..."
"Got to use the bathroom."
"f*cking asshole's"
"still looking at us."
"Well, our idiot cousin"
"did just win the lottery."
"So makes us kind of interesting"
"for a minute or two."
"So, you believe me now?"
"'Bout this whole future thing?"
"Step closer, I'll admit."
"Not a small one, either."
"What's that?"
"Shopping list"
"for our little army."
"Duty roster."
"Where's Conner at?"
"You know Conner."
"I do."
"I also know that maybe"
"asking him to help us"
"might count as a good deed."
"Might."
"Might also get us all killed."
"Come on, Burton."
"He came in pretty damn"
"handy the other night."
"We spun the dial,"
"and thankfully,"
"Conner came up sober."
"Which I guess means"
"cousin Leon is not the only one"
"with a bit of luck on his side."
"What's up? You got"
"something you want to say?"
"Already said it."
"I can't go fixing something"
"that's unfixable, Flynne."
"Not in the middle of all this."
"All right, then,"
"I'm gonna head home."
"Wait, wait, wait. Hold up."
"I talked to Reece"
"about that sim."
"How you got us all"
"out of the barn."
"And?"
"And you let the sheep out 'cause"
"you felt bad for them, right?"
"And then, once they were gone,"
"the tractor was revealed."
"So it was like"
"the sim gave you..."
"...an empathy bonus?"
"But tactically,"
"that would've been"
"sacrificing a valuable asset."
"Those Nazis were about"
"to storm us,"
"and the sheep were"
"the only cover we had."
"Okay."
"How would you"
"have found it then?"
"That's my point."
"You feel bad for Conner."
"I get it. We all do."
"But nobody's handing out any"
"empathy bonuses here, Flynne."
"In the real world, there ain't"
"gonna be no f*cking tractor."
"Sure."
"But if there were one..."
"...you wouldn't have found it."
"Now would you?"
"I'll see you at home."
"Damn it, Flynne."
"...of Entomology"
"at Cornell University."
"Each individual bee"
"has a significant role"
"to play serving the larger"
"needs of the colony."
"Workers, the drones, the queen,"
"they all contribute"
"to the healthy functioning"
"of the hive."
"And none of them,"
"not even the queen herself,"
"can survive without"
"the support of the others."
"However,"
"despite their cooperative"
"and highly regimented society,"
"environmental pressures have"
"placed the population of bees"
"into free fall, which has led"
"to a cascade"
"of agricultural deficiencies"
"and economic turmoil"
"in our own society."
"For instance,"
"a study conducted in California"
"with almond farmers found that"
"the absence of bees"
"decreased their annual income"
"by $75,000..."
"You ever worry you might shoot"
"someone with that thing?"
"Wake up startled-like?"
"That why you don't come"
"and visit so much no more?"
"Afraid I might beat you"
"to the draw?"
"You drunk, Conner?"
"I'm something."
"That's for sure."
"You didn't answer"
"my question, though."
"Why don't you come a-visiting?"
"I'm a-visiting now, ain't I?"
"Got so I figured I was gonna"
"find you dead one of these days."
"Didn't know if"
"I could live with that."
"So why are you here now?"
"You disappeared on us,"
"after our night of mayhem."
"The fun seemed"
"to die down pretty quick."
"I've learned I'm not so good"
"with the quiet periods."
"We got an ongoing situation."
"I could use a decent"
"staff sergeant."
"The other night, when I was"
"headed toward your place?"
"Those boys,"
"they heard me coming,"
"hustled into the brush."
"I only saw one of them,"
"but he had me scoped."
"All he had to do"
"was twitch a finger."
"Know what he did?"
"Just let me roll by."
"I figured they was headed"
"to the Baker place,"
"that Jasper crossed"
"Corbell Pickett somehow, and..."
"I kept thinking on it..."
"...as I was going up the road."
"There's only one reason"
"I could guess"
"why that boy would let me by."
"It's pity."
"More I thought on that,"
"the madder I got."
"I mean, I decided"
"I was gonna kill that boy,"
"no matter where he was headed."
"By the time I got back,"
"those fellas had your balls"
"in a nice tight grip."
"Only seemed neighborly"
"to ease the pressure."
"Felt pretty good"
"for about 12 hours or so."
"Almost like I'd made"
"things right for myself."
"How much money"
"you reckon the VA spends,"
"trying to put all us"
"Humpty Dumpties"
"back together again?"
"Less than it would take."
"Turns out they could"
"just let us all"
"start shooting each other."
"Solve the whole damn problem,"
"don't you think?"
"Half of us'd be dead,"
"the rest would be happy."
"Tell me that firefight"
"didn't make you happy, Burton."
"There it is."
"There it most"
"definitely f*cking is,"
"am I right?"
"Am I right?"
"What you got going on out there?"
"Flynne took a trip"
"to future London."
"Saw something"
"she wasn't supposed to."
"Now people from there"
"are hiring folks to kill us."
"I'm pretty f*cked up,"
"but not that f*cked up."
"I didn't say"
"you had to believe me."
"You just need to help."
"Sober up."
"Come camp at our place."
"Leon's there for an offload,"
"if you want it."
"It's not his job no more."
"I don't guess he ever saw it"
"as a job, Conner."
"Probably wouldn't be too happy"
"to hear you describe it"
"that way, either."
"I just told you I killed"
"some boys for pitying me."
"And?"
"You doing the same thing?"
"I was trying for"
"empathy, actually."
"What's the f*cking difference?"
"f*cked if I know, man."
"Look, the offer is there"
"if you want it."
"But the sober part"
"is nonnegotiable."
"You gonna remember me"
"standing here,"
"telling you all this,"
"come morning?"
"I'd say..."
"...it's fifty-fifty."
"Â¿No esposa esta noche, SeÃ±or?"
"Flying free this"
"evening, Manuel."
"Perhaps you'd like"
"una compaÃ±era?"
"Why, you old devil."
"What do you take me for?"
"Un hombre de gran pasiÃ³n, Â¿no?"
"Well, put it like that? I..."
"Guess I wouldn't spurn"
"some company."
"Mm."
"Ah."
"And what is your name, honey?"
"Carmen."
"Ah."
"Like the Chiquita lady?"
"Â¿QuÃ© es eso?"
"Used to be a fruit"
"called the banana."
"Killed off in"
"some sort of fungus."
"Terrible shame."
"You, uh..."
"have any talents"
"I should be aware of?"
"Would you excuse us, seÃ±orita?"
"Hey."
"You're quite a difficult man"
"to contact, Mr. Pickett."
"Our records indicate"
"that you are an individual"
"with some power"
"and influence in Clanton,"
"circa 2030."
"And it also seems"
"that you're a man who doesn't"
"indulge in too many scruples."
"Is that correct?"
"What the f*ck is going on here?"
"We have a situation that"
"would appear to require"
"some local knowledge."
"We'd like to pay you"
"ten million dollars"
"to eliminate two members"
"of your community."
"Who are you? Homeland Security?"
"You f*ckers hacked this thing?"
"We're prepared to transfer 25%"
"into your account now,"
"as a good faith payment."
"The rest will be paid"
"upon completion."
"The individuals'"
"names in question"
"are Flynne and Burton Fisher."
"You think I'm a fool?"
"This is entrapment, asshole."
"Open and shut."
"End game!"
"Jesus Christ."
"f*cking idiots."
"How was Havana?"
"Always better when you're there."
"Oh, I doubt that."
"Bet you get up to all sorts"
"of trouble on your own."
"Some cha-cha-chÃ¡?"
"I'm afraid we might need"
"to take a break"
"from the old Tropicana."
"How come?"
"Corbell?"
"Burton, get up here right now."
"Mama?"
"What are you doing?"
"You okay?"
"I was hungry."
"I thought I was in a dream."
"Mama."
"I can see, Flynne."
"Mama."
"I can see you. I can see you."
"What connection do you have"
"to a man named Corbell Pickett?"
"Now, you won't"
"get anywhere in life"
"if you don't have the courage"
"to be cruel now and then."
"That's the kind"
"of person that he is."
"That ain't who we are."
"There ought to be a simpler way"
"to kill a girl."
"Aelita left a clue"
"as to her potential whereabouts."
"She was always fond of riddles."
"Wilf..."
"that's my house."
"I've arrived."
"They have no idea who"
"they just picked a fight with."
"This is London..."
"...but London 70 years"
"from what you think of"
"as the present."
"You're inside"
"what we call a Peripheral."
"Telepresent."
"Piloting that body"
"as if it were your own."
"I'm thinking you should"
"probably tell me why people"
"are trying to come"
"and kill me and my family."
"Let me show you."
"Burton,"
"get up here right now."
"I can see, Flynne."
"Mama."
"I can see you."
"â™ª Cut my teeth"
"on Daddy's old LGO â™ª"
"â™ª And I lost my mind â™ª"
"â™ª Somewhere in New Mexico â™ª"
"â™ª And TW put"
"a snake on my back..."
"Two-inch polymer"
"on those windows."
"Kevlar plates"
"in the door panels."
"Run-flat tires."
"Thermal night vision."
"Electrified door handles."
"Spike and smoke deployment"
"from the rear."
"Explosive-proof gas tanks."
"All I need is a quick"
"scribble right here,"
"and we are done..."
"and done."
"You go and get"
"religion on us, Corbell?"
"Yeah,"
"sometimes, Tut,"
"a man reaches a point, realizes"
"he's got to make a change."
"I mean, to his core."
"And it appears I've arrived"
"at that frightful juncture."
"Know those billboards I got,"
"road into town?"
"Taking 'em down."
"Putting up these crosses"
"in their place."
"Promoting a..."
"a different sort of venture."
"You stop selling cars,"
"how do we get these serviced?"
"I'm gonna give you"
"a lifetime guarantee, CJ."
"For the rest of your lives."
"Something goes wrong?"
"I'll fix these for free."
"You know I'm true to my word."
"Let's shake on it."
"â™ª I've been higher"
"than a Georgia pine..."
"Here."
"Hop on in."
"See how they feel."
"There you go, boys."
"Here. Allow me."
"Step right on in."
"Feels pretty good, doesn't it?"
"You good?"
"See how that feels."
"It's not working?"
"What's he saying?"
"Well, it appears"
"that these vehicles"
"aren't starting up"
"for our friends."
"Windows and doors"
"aren't opening either."
"Which is unfortunate."
"Locked car, day like today."
"Any idea how hot it can get?"
"No, sir."
"Hundred"
"and forty degrees."
"Takes about an hour."
"Come here!"
"I looked it up."
"Let us out!"
"Should I let them out?"
"You know what I love best"
"about the U.S. military?"
"The way they coin phrases."
"When the leadership of an enemy"
"makes the mistake of"
"gathering in one place,"
"we drop a bomb on them."
"Open the door!"
"Call it a..."
"""decapitation strike."""
"Has a real poetic ring,"
"doesn't it?"
"What the f*ck?!"
"Tut had his doubts, I guess,"
"about that glass"
"being bulletproof."
"Come on, man,"
"I can't f*ckin' breathe!"
"Spray some water on 'em."
"Piece of sh*t!"
"Remind them"
"how thirsty they're gonna get."
"This is f*ckin' bullsh*t, man!"
"Come on! Let us out!"
"I'm gonna f*cking kill you!"
"Now, you won't get"
"anywhere in life, Jasper,"
"if you don't have the courage"
"to be cruel now and then..."
"...just for the pure"
"animal joy of it."
"Kick it out, man!"
"It's hot in here!"
"It's hot in here!"
"You're f*cking dead!"
"Once you're done here,"
"drag those crosses over"
"and lay 'em out on the pavement."
"Uncle Corbell?"
"I'm gonna kill you!"
"You leaving?"
"I'll be back."
"Just got to fetch a hammer."
"Are you peeing"
"in that pool, Corbell?"
"It's my pool, ain't it?"
"You'll grow up one"
"of these days."
"Then what?"
"Probably have to divorce you."
"But I'll have"
"a clean pool, at least."
"So... been thinking"
"on that deposit."
"Way I see it,"
"we got a few choices."
"Safest route?"
"Refuse the money."
"Let the Fishers live out"
"their natural lives."
"Stop visiting Old Havana."
"Riskiest?"
"Take the money."
"Kill the Fishers."
"And if it's some sort of"
"boneheaded"
"Homeland Security setup,"
"you can spend"
"the rest of your days"
"in the Red Onion supermax,"
"feeling like an idiot."
"Or..."
"Take the money."
"Then do nothing."
"Problem being,"
"maybe it isn't a sting."
"And we've crossed"
"someone who has"
"some resources at their disposal"
"along with an inclination"
"to solve disagreements"
"in a rather vigorous manner."
"Can't say I'm liking"
"any of these, hon."
"Sure you can't do better?"
"Jasper."
"His wife, Billy Ann?"
"Best friends with Flynne Fisher."
"You really want to"
"put something like this"
"in the hands of"
"our half-wit nephew?"
"Let the money sit."
"Get Jasper to poke around."
"Find out if anything unusual"
"is happening with the Fishers,"
"and then, revisit the matter."
"And my new friend in Old Havana?"
"Tell him you're busy prepping."
"Might take a minute."
"That makes me"
"look weak, don't it?"
"Does a lion look weak"
"crouching before it pounces?"
"Damn, Flynne."
"Trips to the future."
"Dead bodies behind your house."
"Magic medicine."
"I feel like my head's"
"about to explode."
"Yeah."
"What are we"
"looking at, anyway?"
"Stupid app Burton"
"put on my phone."
"It lets me see the drones."
"I don't know, I guess I..."
"find it kind of soothing."
"Are they"
"up at your house?"
"No, ma'am."
"Yeah."
"They followed us"
"all the way here?"
"Leon followed us"
"all the way here."
"He must've put 'em up."
"That's supposed"
"to make us feel safer?"
"So, if they can tell you"
"about your mama,"
"they must know about you, too."
"Or-or their version of you?"
"I asked them."
"And they stonewalled me."
"I don't know why, but..."
"kind of makes me start to think"
"that I ought to stop asking."
"Because?"
"Must be pretty hard news,"
"don't you think?"
"Them not wanting to"
"tell me this badly?"
"One thing I know for sure."
"There's a lot"
"less people in 70 years."
"Whole lot."
"Oh, sh*t."
"Yeah."
"I know."
"You really believe, don't you?"
"Yeah."
"What are you doing?"
"Gearing up."
"What're you doing?"
"You can't print this here."
"They won't let you."
"Who?"
"Forever Fab, Burton."
"Well, uh, that's us now."
"So we can do whatever we want."
"What are you talking about?"
"We bought it this morning."
"Or Milagros Cold iron did."
"I put Macon and Edward"
"in charge."
"I need to talk to you."
"You need to be in that headset"
"is what you need."
"Outside."
"Now."
"You made Macon"
"and Edward my bosses?"
"They're not your bosses."
"You just said they were..."
"They can't be your bosses"
"if you own the place, nitwit."
"And you don't have time"
"to work here anyway."
"They need you in London."
"Why are you going"
"and acting like you're"
"in charge all of a sudden?"
"There's a lot of"
"moving parts right now."
"And it seemed like"
"you needed the rest."
"We got to be a team here,"
"you understand that?"
"Otherwise, none of"
"this sh*t's gonna work."
"Agreed."
"What's up with your hand?"
"Nothing."
"It's just stiff."
"I don't know."
"Hang your bike on that."
"I'll drive you home."
"Dri...?"
"You bought a car?"
"It's a rental."
"I'll be right there."
"So I woke up from a drunken"
"stupor this morning."
"And guess what I found?"
"Some dumb f*ck said you might"
"have a job for me?"
"Get inside."
"They'll get you sorted out."
"You want a hand?"
"Sorry, man."
"Wrong word."
"sh*t, man."
"You really hurt my feelings."
"Hey, there it go."
"All right, f*ck off then."
"Head on in."
"Put your best foot forward."
"Now you're just"
"being an asshole."
"I'm serious, dude."
"I'd give an arm and a leg"
"for a rig like this."
"You cut me deep."
"I mean it."
"You got a leg up on all of us."
"Hands down."
"This one's for you."
"Motherf*cker."
"Listen, Flynne,"
"we need to talk contingencies."
"Okay?"
"What people need to know."
"When they need to know it."
"I told Reece and them"
"that you were playing a sim."
"And that you saw something"
"you weren't supposed to,"
"and that now somebody"
"wants you dead for it."
"Which I guess has enough"
"truth in it for my comfort."
"For now, at least."
"You?"
"Yeah."
"Which"
"brings us to Mama."
"Where does she think"
"those drugs came from?"
"Hasn't asked yet."
"Well, if she shows them"
"to her doc,"
"we're gonna have"
"some explaining to do."
"Yeah, I think we're gonna have"
"a lot more explaining to do"
"when she shows up to"
"her next appointment seeing."
"I mean, I'd tell her the truth,"
"if I could find a way to make it"
"sound halfway convincing."
"You gonna share"
"what's going on there?"
"I keep losing control of it."
"It just starts squeezing"
"without me meaning it to."
"Headset?"
"Maybe."
"I don't know."
"I told Billy Ann this morning."
"Told her what?"
"Everything."
"Why the f*ck did you do that?"
"Answer me."
"Goddamn it, Burton, don't take"
"that f*cking tone with me."
"I'm not a child."
"Then maybe you should stop"
"f*cking acting like one."
"Goddamn it,"
"pull the car over."
"Pull it over now!"
"I'm not pulling"
"the f*cking car over."
"Goddamn it."
"You know what, Burton?"
"You got your whole little posse"
"in front of that fire outside"
"your f*cking camper, but me?"
"Billy Ann is the only"
"friend that I've got."
"Okay."
"Obviously, it ain't okay."
"Clearly you've got some other"
"sh*t that you're brewing on"
"that you want to say"
"to piss me off."
"You might just want to remember"
"that when you tell"
"Billy Ann something,"
"you're telling Jasper, too."
"Yeah, okay."
"And I told her to keep it"
"a f*cking secret."
"That's not how it works, Flynne."
"You can't expect a married couple..."
"You don't know"
"the first f*cking thing about"
"a married f*cking couple"
"and how it works."
"Who's Jasper's uncle?"
"f*ck."
"They're waiting on you."
"Great."
"Oh."
"For some reason, I assumed"
"it would be stored on a bed."
"That's because"
"you're a romantic, Wilf."
"It's just a thing until"
"our polt arrives."
"And where else"
"would you keep a thing"
"but in a box?"
"Mm."
"Ash just now asked..."
"...if I'd ever killed a man."
"Awake and rise."
"Why would she ask that, Lev?"
"I was simply reassuring her"
"that you're the right"
"person to find Aelita."
"As you most certainly are."
"There's no shame"
"in what you did."
"Quite the contrary."
"My family, the Klept"
"oligarchy at large,"
"it's why we took you in."
"Protected you."
"Treated you as one of our own."
"Well, almost."
"You've never told"
"anyone, have you?"
"What you did to those neoprims?"
"Not even Aelita?"
"You will never be fully yourself"
"until you embrace"
"that part of your soul."
"Lay claim to its power."
"Otherwise, you're just"
"as empty as this thing."
"Do you feel like a thing?"
"A thing is an insensate"
"material object."
"Technically, I qualify as such."
"But I'm afraid"
"your question lacks..."
"And welcome back."
"Please tell me you do not"
"keep me in a box"
"when I'm not here."
"No, no, no."
"Of course not."
"We're in the kitchen again."
"Seems"
"simple enough to me"
"when it's laid out like that."
"We kidnapped the Mariel woman."
"Stole her eyeball."
"Used that to get into"
"the underground place."
"Got caught."
"Your Aelita woman ran away"
"while I got myself killed."
"I'm not really a detective,"
"but I feel like that's more"
"than enough to get going on."
"Start with the party."
"Find out"
"who the Mariel woman is"
"and go from there."
"Mariel Raphael."
"Assistant security manager"
"at The Research Institute."
"Which is also Aelita's"
"place of employment."
"It would seem logical"
"to surmise that you used"
"her iris to gain access"
"to one of the institute's"
"restricted facilities."
"Which immediately makes"
"everything that follows"
"far more complex than"
"it might otherwise be."
"More dangerous, too."
"Y'all are afraid of"
"that place, huh?"
"Let's just say"
"that minimizing"
"our exposure to the RI"
"would be in our"
"collective self-interest."
"Weren't y'all stealing"
"from it, though?"
"Using Aelita to sneak"
"into my world?"
"Stealing seems a strong word."
"Sneaking, too."
"Then, what would you call it?"
"I believe you had something you"
"wanted to ask this young lady."
"What connection do you have"
"to a man named Corbell Pickett?"
"None. And I'd like"
"to keep it that way."
"Why?"
"He's a narcotics manufacturer in your region."
"Quite violent."
"A grisly"
"discovery in Clanton,"
"North Carolina this morning."
"Twelve bodies found hanging"
"from crosses on Siltwell Road..."
"I know who Corbell"
"f*cking Pickett is."
"...reportedly"
"members of the Mad Dogs cartel."
"What he is, too."
"Just turn that sh*t off, please."
"...or the"
"perpetrators behind it,"
"please call..."
"We've been monitoring"
"your stub's web traffic."
"We've detected"
"a considerable spike in interest"
"from his IP address."
"Interest in what?"
"You and your family."
"Which would"
"lead us to believe"
"that someone from here"
"might have contacted him."
"In the hopes of"
"recruiting him to harm you."
"Then you need to send me back."
"Now, I mean."
"You keep looking for Aelita,"
"and I'll be back in an hour."
"Wolfgang."
"Uh, have they been immunized?"
"In full compliance with"
"state guidelines."
"How old are you, darling?"
"I'll be ten in 27 days."
"Wolf is eight."
"Open."
"Needs a bit of work,"
"but not terrible."
"The stipend from the state"
"ought to cover such expenses."
"We won't require any charity."
"We've been called upon"
"by our country"
"to assist with the reformation."
"It's our duty to do so."
"Would you like to come"
"and live with us in Oxfords hire?"
"Can Wolf come?"
"They were reclaimed"
"together from the streets."
"A bonded pair."
"We were only planning"
"to adopt one."
"Well, perhaps"
"in that case we could..."
"I'm not going without Wolf."
"Wolf is the boy's name?"
"Short for Wolfgang."
"DNA reveals German"
"and North African heritage."
"Do you like your name?"
"Yes, sir."
"But say we wanted"
"to call you by a different name,"
"something a little"
"more traditional."
"Like, um... Wilfred."
"Would that be okay?"
"I can be Wilfred."
"Good boy."
"â™ª Mary, Mary â™ª"
"â™ª Quite contrary â™ª"
"â™ª How does your garden grow? â™ª"
"â™ª With silver bells â™ª"
"â™ª And cockleshells â™ª"
"Aelita?"
"â™ª And pretty maids"
"all in a row â™ª"
"â™ª Mistress Mary,"
"quite contrary â™ª"
"â™ª How does your"
"garden grow? â™ª Wilfred?"
"â™ª With silver bells"
"and cockleshells..."
"Hello, Mum."
"When was she last here?"
"It's been years."
"Like you."
"Prior to your father's death,"
"I'm certain of that."
"I still haven't forgiven you..."
"You know, both of you..."
"For not attending his funeral."
"We don't have to do this, do we?"
"It was quite embarrassing."
"Not that I'm"
"expecting an apology."
"But as usual, you're asking"
"the wrong question"
"and therefore,"
"getting the wrong answer."
"What I suspect"
"you meant to ask is,"
"when was the last time"
"I saw Aelita?"
"And?"
"A month ago."
"Perhaps not even quite that."
"I was in St. James's."
"I came out of Wiltons."
"Practically ran right into her."
"And did you speak?"
"I attempted"
"a conversation."
"But Aelita being Aelita,"
"the effort proved to be"
"rather one-sided."
"I asked her"
"where she was staying."
"She took on that rather"
"unattractive haughty air"
"that she can sometimes"
"assume and said,"
"""Where snow last fell"
"in London."""
"""Where snow last fell"
"in London."""
"After all these years,"
"I can't quite understand"
"why she needs to play"
"at such riddles."
"She grew affronted"
"when I expressed confusion."
"Said that if I'd ever bothered"
"to pay the slightest"
"degree of attention,"
"I'd know precisely"
"what she meant."
"But you paid attention, Wilfred."
"And do you know what she meant?"
"You see?"
"Oh, do sit, Wilfred."
"Even for a moment."
"It's so tiresome to have you"
"looming over me like that."
"Sometimes,"
"when I can't sleep,"
"I lie there trying"
"to solve the riddle"
"of your sister and you."
"I suppose your father"
"and I had our failings."
"Or perhaps our standards"
"were simply too high,"
"given the particularities"
"of your origin."
"But you can't deny we gave you"
"the absolute"
"top shelf of everything."
"Schooling."
"Opportunity. A..."
"Thank you, dear."
"My pleasure, ma'am."
"I wouldn't"
"expect you to understand."
"Try me."
"A soul grows lonely, Wilfred."
"Living without companionship."
"A generic model"
"wouldn't suffice?"
"Well, yes, yes."
"I suppose it is all"
"very sentimental of me."
"But there was"
"something about Aelita..."
"Something in the way"
"she carried herself..."
"That I always found"
"deeply comforting."
"Hmm."
"Untainted by any unattractive"
"quirks of personality, you mean?"
"As I said, I wouldn't"
"expect you to understand."
"I've said all I know"
"about her whereabouts."
"And our tea has grown"
"unpalatably tepid."
"So it might be time"
"for you to be on your way,"
"don't you think?"
"I'll take care"
"of Pickett."
"What do you mean"
"""take care"" of him?"
"Burton, you can't go and kill"
"Corbell Pickett in cold blood."
"You said he was"
"planning to kill us."
"There's nothing too"
"hot-blooded about that."
"But that's the kind of"
"person that he is."
"That ain't who we are."
"I don't know if you know this,"
"but the Corps actually"
"spent a lot of money"
"making me exactly"
"that kind of person."
"Come on, Burton, you're not"
"in the Marine Corps anymore."
"You know what semper means?"
"I do."
"I also know what fidelis means."
"So I think you got to"
"ask yourself..."
"loyal to what?"
"All right, how about this?"
"You find me a workable plan..."
"...or we go with mine."
"You'll talk to me first?"
"Before you make any decisions?"
"Agreed."
"Say it."
"We'll talk about it first."
"I promise."
"sh*t."
"And that goes for Conner, too!"
"Welcome back."
"I've programmed the car"
"to move in a grid"
"with Buckingham Palace"
"at its center."
"If you see anything"
"familiar from that night,"
"we can try to trace"
"your route back to Aelita's."
"What happened to her?"
"Mariel? Afterward, I mean?"
"Assemblers can work miracles."
"I'm sure she's fine."
"I'm not asking you that so you"
"can make me feel better, Wilf."
"She appears to have vanished."
"Assemblers can do that, too."
"Aelita killed her?"
"Either Aelita or the RI."
"They don't take fondly"
"to security lapses there,"
"I'm afraid."
"I thought I was playing a sim."
"Yes, well."
"It turns out if you prick us,"
"we bleed."
"Wait, go back."
"I think we turned there."
"I don't know."
"Why don't we take a walk"
"for a bit then?"
"See if anything jumps out."
"You go that way."
"I'll go here."
"We can link up so you can see"
"what I'm seeing."
"Link up?"
"You'll hear a ringing."
"When you do, swipe,"
"tap your thumb and forefinger."
"Holy sh*t."
"It's set to full sensory."
"Not just visual and aural."
"Ah..."
"So it might take"
"a moment to acclimate."
"Ah, f*ck, I feel sick."
"Ah, yes."
"My hangover, I imagine."
"You should be able"
"to calibrate it here."
"Better?"
"Yeah."
"This is the weirdest"
"f*cking thing I've ever felt."
"I mean, it's like I'm..."
"I'm part of you?"
"Does that make sense?"
"Does it work both ways?"
"What do I feel like?"
"What?"
"You're all rainbows"
"and unicorns, Ms. Fisher."
"f*ck off."
"With a bluesy sort of"
"soundtrack underneath."
"Heavy bass."
"Up or down."
"To pull me in or out."
"Jasper."
"I think Mr. Pickett and I"
"are overdue for a discussion."
"How can I be of assistance?"
"I've got a carrot"
"and I've got a stick,"
"Mr. Pickett."
"You want the carrot first?"
"How much did they promise"
"for you to make me"
"and my sister dead?"
"I don't know what"
"you're talking about."
"Going rate a few nights"
"ago was nine million dollars."
"So if they told you"
"any less than that..."
"...they obviously don't"
"think too highly of you."
"What're you mixed up in?"
"Nothing"
"that'll encroach"
"on your line"
"of business, I promise."
"But I can offer you"
"200 grand a week"
"just to leave us the f*ck alone."
"So, why don't we shake on it"
"and I'll be on my way."
"I'm curious about the stick."
"You know what these are?"
"Heard about them."
"What, exactly?"
"How they"
"messed you up pretty good."
"And I thank you"
"for your service."
"Can I tell you a story?"
"The Corps targets rural towns"
"for haptic recruitment."
"Kids who grew up together offer"
"ready-made small-unit cohesion."
"Plug the haptics in"
"and you got a unified organism."
"Speed, intensity,"
"violence of action."
"Honestly,"
"when it got hot enough,"
"generally, I wasn't even"
"aware of what I was doing."
"Like a hand wouldn't be,"
"if you get my meaning."
"Anyway, when the war was over,"
"I was at Quantico."
"Walked into a bar."
"Saw a guy sitting on a stool..."
"...and I just blacked out."
"Gone."
"When I came to,"
"I was standing over that guy."
"Found that I'd beaten him"
"'bout a half inch shy of death."
"I'd never even seen him before."
"But a sergeant in my unit..."
"he'd gotten jumped"
"by that motherf*cker"
"when he was 16 years old."
"And because of the haptics,"
"I had that in me."
"Along with a visceral imperative"
"to destroy that son of a bitch,"
"without even knowing why."
"That is quite a tale."
"But if there's a moral in it,"
"I believe I missed it."
"If anything happens"
"to me or my sister,"
"and you're behind it,"
"you ought to have"
"your affairs in order."
"'Cause I'm not just me now."
"I'm all the men I served with."
"That's your best stick?"
"You feel safe here, Mr. Pickett?"
"You're too young"
"to remember, maybe."
"But this town was"
"a real sh*thole once."
"Run by the lowest sort of trash."
"I changed that."
"Pretty much overnight."
"Made it a nice place"
"to live again."
"Clean, quiet."
"My town."
"So, yeah."
"Yeah, I guess I do feel"
"pretty safe here."
"The next one's"
"in your f*cking ear."
"That's my f*cking stick."
"Two hundred a week sound good?"
"Appreciate it, man."
"Acrophobic?"
"Not particularly."
"Good."
"Walk with me."
"I need some air."
"The R.I. Headquarters was"
"the first of our air scrubbers."
"Built long before you joined us."
"Do you know how they work?"
"Only in the broader sense."
"Tell me."
"They capture carbon"
"from the atmosphere."
"But beyond that,"
"the specific technology?"
"It would be like"
"asking me how a bird flies."
"Hmm."
"You're taking too much time."
"We can't afford it."
"The stub..."
"Yes."
"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
"It presents unique challenges."
"I'm well aware."
"Maybe you have"
"too many moving parts."
"Teams of mercenaries."
"Impenetrable"
"small-town alliances."
"It seems there ought to be"
"a simpler way to kill a girl,"
"doesn't it?"
"Just one person."
"With the appropriate weapon?"
"And what about our problems"
"in the here and now?"
"It appears"
"that Aelita West"
"went to school"
"with Grace Hogart."
"They were roommates for a year."
"Well, that's distressing."
"I've always been"
"quite fond of Grace."
"I can address it, if you'd like."
"No."
"I will."
"Have you discovered"
"the source of Aelita's funding?"
"We're still struggling"
"to untangle that."
"You were right, though."
"There's a Klept feel to it."
"Which specific family"
"remains murky,"
"but if I had to guess..."
"I don't want you"
"to guess, Daniel."
"I want you to"
"find out for certain."
"And then I want a body count."
"I'm sure you're aware that"
"I could easily eliminate you."
"In any number of ways,"
"with the simple wave of my hand."
"But..."
"I value you, Daniel."
"And I wouldn't want you serving"
"the needs of the Institute"
"simply out of fear,"
"which is the weakest"
"type of motivation."
"Powerful only in the short term."
"Doctor!"
"They flap their wings."
"Ma'am?"
"Birds."
"That's how they fly."
"Kiss, kiss, Daniel."
"Get it done."
"Aelita says I'm likely"
"not to exist in ten years."
"What'd she mean by that?"
"Hello? You there?"
"Wilf?"
"When we find Aelita,"
"you can ask her"
"because I have no idea."
"She called me a polt."
"What's that mean?"
"Short for poltergeist."
"That's how we refer to people"
"from the stub."
"Like a ghost."
"Here but not here."
"Perfect"
"accomplice, you mean."
"Speaking of which,"
"is there any reason"
"I should be worried"
"about the police?"
"Turn right at the corner."
"Walk in an unhurried manner."
"I'll approach from"
"the opposite direction."
"Yes?"
"Please tell me"
"the Peripheral is registered."
"It is."
"With a few frowned-upon"
"augmentations."
"Okay, right, and you"
"couldn't tell me that"
"before I stepped out with it?"
"What's the problem?"
"We separated"
"to cover more ground."
"Now a Met koid is following her."
"Well, catch up to her,"
"and for Christ's sake,"
"don't let her talk"
"to the damn thing."
"If the Met finds out"
"Flynne is from the stub,"
"you're on your own."
"We'll scrub all connection."
"I'll be sure to post"
"a care package to you"
"in Wakefield prison, though."
"For f*ck's sake, Ash."
"I could just send her home now."
"No, it'll look dodgy."
"Just wait for my prompt."
"I'll be listening."
"Follow my lead."
"And when you see me"
"touch my chin,"
"ask if you can go home."
"May we be of assistance,"
"Constable?"
"This Peripheral"
"has been moving"
"about the neighborhood"
"in a manner that violates"
"algorithmic predictions,"
"by several degrees of certainty."
"I was dispatched to investigate."
"Identity, sir?"
"Wilf Netherton."
"Confirmed."
"And this is Rainey Portis,"
"in the Peripheral."
"A citizen of Canada."
"If you check, I think you'll see"
"I applied for a"
"remote-visit visa in her name."
"Ten trips."
"Two of which have been used."
"This being the third."
"A third visit was neither"
"requested nor approved."
"Well, Rainey was"
"feeling spontaneous."
"Your remote visit is revoked."
"Please surrender"
"the Peripheral immediately"
"for inspection and deconstruction."
"You'll be wondering why"
"we exited the vehicle,"
"I suppose."
"Bit of an argument, actually."
"I'd really value your opinion,"
"if you wouldn't mind."
"On Rainey's first two visits,"
"she mentioned how the Peripheral"
"didn't look much like her."
"Wanted me to rent"
"a different model"
"next time she came to London."
"But..."
"what she didn't know is"
"the peri isn't a rental."
"I own it."
"It was modeled"
"on an ex-girlfriend."
"And it seemed easier"
"to just keep using it"
"which was lazy of me and wrong"
"because when Rainey"
"arrived this time"
"and found herself"
"in the same peri,"
"she grew angry."
"Said I must not respect her"
"if I ignored her requests"
"so cavalierly."
"She jumped out of the car."
"Which led us here"
"to this present moment."
"But here's the thing, Constable."
"I believe I'm starting to have"
"feelings for this woman."
"Or at least I'm feeling"
"the possibility of feelings,"
"if you follow my drift."
"I find you extremely alluring."
"Intelligent."
"Intriguing."
"Intrepid."
"Can't you f*cking see that?"
"May I go home now, Constable?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'd advise you to register"
"her visit as soon as possible,"
"Mr. Netherton."
"Yes, of course, Constable."
"Good day."
"Follow me."
"Dr. Nuland?"
"Grace."
"Thank you for popping by"
"on such short notice."
"Of course."
"Feels like..."
"we never really have much"
"of a chance to chat, do we?"
"Feels like"
"a dereliction on my part."
"Well, we all know"
"how terribly busy you are."
"Do you have"
"a favorite spot?"
"Ma'am?"
"A place you go to, to revive your spirits?"
"This is mine."
"It's the view"
"that nourishes you?"
"The bees."
"Their ignorance, I mean."
"I find it cautionary,"
"in a bracing way."
"They go about their business"
"so assiduously"
"without any awareness"
"of how vulnerable they are."
"All the things"
"that killed them off"
"in the first place,"
"they're still out there."
"We do our best"
"to keep them at bay, of course."
"But one momentary lapse"
"in vigilance, and a whole"
"cascade of crisis descends."
"Do you know they've had"
"two extinction events,"
"just in the past five years?"
"And then, well, you know..."
"that long climb back up"
"from nothingness."
"Well, they're lucky"
"they have you."
"We're no different, really."
"People."
"We look out on all this"
"and we imagine"
"that the Jackpot,"
"with all its horrors,"
"is safely buried in the past."
"But the labor"
"involved to keep it so."
"The care..."
"You'd be the first"
"to understand, though,"
"wouldn't you?"
"That's the whole point"
"of the work you're doing."
"The data you're bringing"
"back from the stub"
"may save us all one day."
"From ourselves."
"I'm honored to be"
"in a position to help, Doctor."
"Do you have many friends, Grace?"
"Some."
"Aelita West."
"Does she count as one?"
"I suppose."
"We boarded together in school."
"Then you're"
"aware she was employed"
"in our Biodiversity Department."
"Was?"
"How do you suppose"
"someone in Grains and Legumes"
"might become aware of"
"our Stub Research Division?"
"She was curious, so I..."
"It's not as if I shared"
"anything of substance, Doctor."
"I-I would never..."
"There was a country"
"called Paraguay once,"
"before the Jackpot."
"Do you know it?"
"No."
"People there"
"had a saying."
"If you feel compelled"
"to share a secret,"
"I mean, a really"
"important secret..."
"An existentially important one..."
"Then you should dig"
"a grave first."
"For who?"
"For whom, dear."
"Either for the person"
"you're telling..."
"...or for yourself."
"I'm so sorry, Doctor."
"I've let you down."
"I can see that."
"There's a chemical in the tea."
"As your body processes it,"
"your sweat begins to mimic"
"a pheromone hornets release."
"It's gotten our little friends"
"a tad agitated, I'm afraid."
"You understand, don't you?"
"How you've left me no choice?"
"I have two small children."
"That's it. Exactly."
"Think of them."
"Think of the lengths"
"you'd go to, to protect them."
"Dr. Nuland, please."
"Please."
"Please don't, I beg you."
"Please. Please don't."
"I'll do anything."
"Ask you a question?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Using a urinal,"
"how hard is it to get"
"the pee in the right spot?"
"And by right spot,"
"I mean anywhere but the floor."
"It ain't me doing it."
"Well, I mean, you could get"
"your friends to stop, too."
"Start a trend."
"I could try,"
"if you want, but..."
"to be fair,"
"women do have it easier."
"Sitting down and all."
"Which was a joke."
"It was a joke."
"Mm-hmm. Super funny, too."
"Thanks."
"This is home, Jasper."
"Time to shut off the truck."
"I got to drop"
"something at my uncle's."
"What?"
"I don't know."
"It's a bag."
"Better not be any drugs in there."
"There ain't."
"How do you know?"
"'Cause my uncle understands"
"how you feel about that."
"Also, it's from Forever Fab."
"Flynne"
"gave it to you?"
"Macon and Edward."
"Billy Ann..."
"don't."
"I'll get dinner started"
"if you do me a favor."
"Hmm?"
"Find out what this is about."
"How am I supposed to do that?"
"Figure it out."
"I'm not asking you how"
"to get dinner going, am I?"
"And don't even think about"
"taking any of that,"
"Jasper Baker."
"Jesus, Billy Ann."
"I'm not an idiot."
"Okay."

"Any trouble with that?"
"No, sir."
"I told them what I was after,"
"and they handed it over."
"Have a peek inside?"
"No."
"You know I wouldn't feel right"
"doing that, Uncle Corbell."
"I mean, I can kind of"
"tell what's in it."
"I think. Just by the feel."
"And what's your guess?"
"Money."
"Mm."
"Oh..."
"From the Fisher family."
"Neighbors of yours, aren't they?"
"Yeah."
"You, uh,"
"find it at all surprising?"
"Them paying me 200 grand?"
"Little bit,"
"I'll be honest, yeah."
"What if I told you"
"they were planning to"
"keep doing it, once a week"
"for the foreseeable future?"
"I don't know,"
"I suppose I'd wonder"
"where all the money"
"was coming from."
"You are"
"a smart young man, Jasper."
"For that is indeed"
"the million dollar question."
"You want one?"
"No, I wouldn't, uh..."
"I mean..."
"Go ahead, take it."
"Go ahead."
"All right."
"Thanks."
"Now, I'm gonna offer you"
"a valuable life lesson here."
"Hmm?"
"Before you accept"
"any cash from someone,"
"always ask what they"
"might want in exchange."
"No, no, no, no. Too late."
"You've taken it."
"What do you, uh..."
"What do you want in exchange?"
"For you to find the answer to"
"that million dollar question."
"You mean, like..."
"Look,"
"tell you straight up."
"I'm a little concerned"
"about the Fishers."
"I think they've gotten"
"themselves involved"
"in something that's maybe a tad"
"bigger than they can handle."
"You remember the Mad Dogs?"
"That's the sort of wickedness"
"we're talking about."
"Coming back to our town."
"Now, the more I know,"
"the more I can"
"watch out for the Fishers."
"'Cause, uh, they seem"
"like nice folks."
"They are."
"So you wouldn't want anything"

"Mm-mm."
"Well."
"Right."
"Okay."
"Hey,"
"what's it feel like"

"Uh..."
"It's hard to describe."
"Why you asking?"
"Well, I think I did it."
"Or I guess something"
"similar to it."
"With Wilf."
"You know?"
"You better"
"be careful, now."
"Why?"
"It takes training"
"to handle a merge."
"Folks can get lost in it."
"Lost how?"
"Well, two souls"
"coming together as one"
"can kind of feel"
"a lot like love,"
"if you don't know"
"any better."
"Haptic drift,"
"that's what they call it."
"Right."
"Welcome back."
"It ain't real, is it?"
"No, I'm afraid."
"Aelita left a clue as to her"
"potential whereabouts."
"A riddle."
"She was always fond of riddles."
"I was trying to get"
"into her frame of mind."
"What was it?"
"The clue."
"""Where snow last fell"
"in London."""
"My mother had a painting over"
"her bureau. It said, um..."
"""Battle of the Abbey."
"The Spot Where Harold Fell."""
"You don't think that..."
"I mean, Snow could be a person,"
"do you?"
"John Snow."
"Who's that?"
"One of Aelita's"
"intellectual heroes."
"An English doctor."
"He discovered"
"how cholera spread."
"Where did John Snow die?"
"In London."
"On June 16, 1858."
"Where precisely?"
"18 Sackville"
"Street."
"Let's go."
"To where Snow"
"last fell in London."
"I've arrived."
"Someone got here before us."
"We have one of those"
"back at home."
"The exact same?"
"Yeah."
"Ours is broken, too."
"It stopped after my dad died."
"What time"
"is your clock set to?"
"2:15."
"Well done."
"What happened to them?"
"Peripherals."
"Abandoned for days"
"without a nutrient bath."
"Ash and Ossian should be"
"able to trace the connections"
"back to their operators."
"What?"
"Burton."
"What is it?"
"It's an implant."
"Aelita's?"
"She must have"
"removed it after the attack"
"so she couldn't be traced."
"We should go."
"Welcome back, Ms. Fisher."
"And"
"Wilfred Netherton, is it?"
"Remember this?"
"I assume you're thinking,"
"""Kill me,"
"then game over,"" right?"
"But I assure you,"
"the trauma leaves a mark."
"Hurts a little, don't it?"
"What do you want with me?"
"Huh? Answer me!"
"She won't stop."
"Not till you're dead."
"You're only delaying"
"the inevitable."
"Drawing out the pain."
"You took something."
"What?"
"I wanna go back, Burton."
"I'm worried you're not"
"thinking clearly."
"How long"
"do you think it's gonna be"
"till someone else comes around"
"wanting to kill us?"
"Your constant slipping away"
"is as if you"
"couldn't be trusted."
"So this is what's coming"
"in my world."
"Aelita says I'm likely"
"not to exist in ten years."
"What does she mean by that?"
"The trauma leaves a mark."
"When I can't sleep,"
"I try to solve"
"the riddle"
"of your sister and you."
"We were only planning"
"to adopt one."
"Well, perhaps in that case we could..."
"I'm not going without Wolf."
"What's it feel like when"
"you link up with your haptics?"
"It can kind of feel a lot like"
"love if you don't know"
"any better."
"Some dumb f*ck said"
"you might have a job for me?"
"I've got a carrot,"
"and I've got a stick."
"I'm curious about the stick."
"Next one's"
"in your f*cking ear."
"Aye, Wolfy,"
"oi, into the pot."
"Come on."
"That's it."
"So what you're telling me is"
"that's it from the borough?"
"Omar's crew got there first."
"You nicked some, didn't you?!"
"Angus, stop!"
"You damn liar!"
"You thief!"
"Angus, let go!"
"Stop!"
"Thief."
"Quit mucking about, Angus."
"Get on with it."
"What're you doing?"
"I'm being fair."
"He ain't pulling his weight."
"I'm pulling enough for him."
"Then give him your lot."
"I don't want it."
"Fine. I'll give it to the mouse."
"Then what will happen?"
"Then... he'll ask"
"for a splash of milk."
"Next in line!"
"What's that?"
"They're giving away free food."
"Give that back!"
"Dodgy, innit?"
"I never seen that place before."
"You know what, Wolfy?"
"It's about time"
"you earn your keep."
"Go have a look for us."
"He's not doing that."
"Kids are getting snatched."
"I'm sorry."
"Do you need your girlfriend"
"protecting you?"
"Good lad."
"The city wants"
"to clear the streets,"
"and that includes us, too."
"Don't be stupid, Wolf."
"You see that? You see that?"
"That's the last time"
"I'll see you, Wolf."
"I'm not getting scooped."
"Wolf!"
"Wolf!"
"Just one"
"for everyone!"
"Aelita!"
"Wolf!"
"Aelita!"
"Wolf!"
"Aelita!"
"Wolf!"
"Aelita!"
"Wolf!"
"Aelita!"
"An implant"
"and two peripheral CPUs?"
"This is all"
"that's left of Aelita?"
"This is all quite distressing."
"I'm half tempted"
"to just dump these in the river"
"and have done with it."
"Ash and Ossian"
"should be able to trace"
"where the Peripherals"
"were piloted from."
"And if they can unlock"
"Aelita's implant..."
"Doubtful, given the encryption."
"All I'm saying is there are"
"other avenues for us to pursue."
"And rather a few"
"for others to pursue,"
"starting with a corpse,"
"which will be discovered soon,"
"no doubt, if it hasn't already."
"And your DNA,"
"we must presume,"
"is scattered rather liberally"
"all over the place."
"I would send a... team"
"to scrub the site, but"
"if they were discovered there,"
"well..."
"At the very least,"
"you must gird yourself"
"for the harsh reality"
"of Aelita's death."
"Why?"
"Without the immunity boost"
"of her implant,"
"how long could she last?"
"What the f*ck?"
"Flynne!"
"We've got company."
"What's the word,"
"Tommy?"
"Oh, just thought"
"I should come by."
"Say hey."
"Saw you and Corbell Pickett"
"shaking hands."
"Down at Jimmy's."
"It had me a bit concerned."
"All the abandoned vehicles."
"That bullet."
"All them drones you got up."
"So, thought I'd come by"
"for a visit."
"My own clothes, my own truck."
"Just to make it clear,"
"I'm here as a friend."
"Not as a deputy."
"Appreciate that, Tommy."
"Everything you're saying, but,"
"uh..."
"you don't have"
"to worry about us."
"What about you, Flynne?"
"You okay?"
"Yeah."
"Yeah, we both are."
"Well, all right, then."
"Said what I had to."
"You two, uh, think on it maybe."
"And, uh, Burton?"
"Try to remember..."
"the part"
"about me being your friend?"
"Look like you could use one."
"I surely will."
"I f*cking hate it,"
"Burton."
"Lying to him like that."
"I mean, I..."
"I can't keep doing it."
"There's a dozen"
"dead bodies out back."
"It's easy for Tommy"
"to say he's our friend,"
"as long as he doesn't know"
"about 'em."
"But as soon as he does,"
"he's also gonna remember"
"he's a cop."
"There's no way around that."
"Why can't we just tell him what"
"we're telling everyone else?"
"You can't really deny that"
"we need some help right now."
"I guess I'm worried"
"you're not thinking clearly."
"What?"
"You can't be"
"rational about this."
"You f*cking kidding me,"
"right now? Rational?"
"Why? 'Cause I'm a woman?"
"That's not what I'm saying, Flynne."
"Not everyone is"
"as cold-blooded as you"
"and your f*cking"
"jarhead friends, all right?"
"Not everyone wants to be."
"You're too tangled up in this."
"Tangled up in what?"
"Have you been going"
"through my f*cking trash?"
"It was right there, Flynne."
"You need to leave."
"Get the f*ck out of my room,"
"Burton, now."
"Go!"
"Hey!"
"I know a lot of terrible sh*t"
"happened to you off in the war."
"I get that,"
"and I f*cking hate it."
"But you went"
"because you chose to."
"And you got to see"
"a whole lot of stuff"
"before the bad stuff happened,"
"okay, but I had to stay here."
"Okay, it was me who picked up"
"the pieces after Dad died."
"And when Mama got sick"
"and then when your ass got home."
"That was me, Burton!"
"It was all f*cking me!"
"And I didn't have nothing,"
"Burton."
"I know it, Flynne."
"I had nothing."
"I had nothing, just sims"
"and a stupid f*cking crush."
"And I know it's dumb, okay?"
"I'm not an idiot."
"Flynne."
"But it mattered to me."
"Flynne. Flynne!"
"It mattered to me because it f*cking helped."
"And you have no f*cking"
"right at all, no right"
"to come in my room"
"and say that sh*t to me!"
"Flynne. Flynne?"
"Oh, f*ck."
"Hey. Hey. Flynne?"
"Leon!"
"Wasn't he"
"a bit lighter?"
"Thinner around"
"the shoulders, I mean?"
"We used"
"his most recent scan, Doctor,"
"from seven weeks ago."
"Perhaps once we input"
"gait and posture analysis,"
"his gestalt impression"
"will be different."
"I assumed you'd already done that."
"No, ma'am."
"But if you..."
"Yes. Please."
"By all means."
"Mm, better."
"Speak."
"Model X409-27A."
"At your service, ma'am."
"Have you input anything?"
"We were told you wanted"
"a clean system, Doctor."
"Voice scan"
"and sense of self, please."
"I'll take care of the rest."
"Speak."
"It's nice"
"to see you again,"
"Dr. Nuland."
"The pitch is rather high."
"Speak."
"Does this fit your recollection?"
"I'll handle it from here."
"Poor Daniel."
"No pun intended,"
"but things did take"
"a rather sharp turn"
"for us there, didn't they?"
"I'm afraid so, ma'am."
"This is our most recent model,"
"if that's any solace."
"There's only a few"
"in service yet."
"I suppose one could see it"
"as a sort of honor."
"I'm delighted to hear it, ma'am."
"Oh, no, you sound"
"far too agreeable, though."
"Um, adjust, please."
"Decreasing amicability."
"By what percent?"
"Try 20."
"If that's what you really want."
"Lovely."
"Now..."
"what do we have"
"from your unfortunate encounter"
"with mortality the other night?"
"Wilf Netherton."
"Adoptive brother to Aelita West."
"Also known associate"
"of Lev Zubov."
"There's our Klept connection"
"at last."
"Which would seem"
"to rather unhappily"
"complicate the situation."
"I defer to your judgment,"
"of course."
"Here and always."
"Although in this particular"
"case, I would tend to disagree."
"You want to kill him, don't you?"
"Oh, very much so, Doctor."
"Tell me,"
"where I can find Lev Zubov now?"
"Scanning localization data."
"Subject geolocated"
"in Virginia Water."
"This is stupid,"
"Burton."
"I feel fine."
"You didn't look fine 20 minutes ago."
"You still don't."
"I thought that we were supposed to stay quiet,"
"not tell people stuff"
"they don't really need to know."
"You had a f*cking seizure,"
"Flynne."
"Tyra Ansted had a seizure"
"in tenth grade, remember that?"
"In the middle of chemistry."
"Never happened to her again."
"Tyra Ansted wasn't"
"using a headset"
"so she could travel to the f*cking future."
"It's not time travel."
"It's data transfer."
"And all she's gonna tell me is"
"to not wear a f*cking headset."
"Then we'll deal with it."
"How?"
"You're not putting on"
"the headset again if it's"
"harming you, Flynne, period."
"Goddamn it."
"Mm."
"You okay?"
"f*cking seriously?"
"You just got to give me a little"
"bit of f*cking space, Burton."
"Hey, hey."
"What?"
"It's Dee Dee in there."
"And?"
"And she's Tommy's fiancÃ©e."
"Are you cool with that?"
"Jesus Christ."
"I mean, it seems like you got..."
"Look, remember when you were 12"
"and you and Conner"
"hid that f*cking weed"
"in the attic and I found it?"
"What happened?"
"I flushed it down the toilet."
"And said?"
"""Let's never talk about this again."""
"Uh-huh. This is the first time"
"I brought it up since then."
"Ain't it? How about you try"
"doing that for me?"
"Please?"
"Well, I'll be"
"honest with you, Flynne,"
"we have ourselves"
"a bit of a mystery here."
"The way Burton is describing"
"what happened makes it sound"
"like a classic"
"tonic-clonic seizure."
"What they used to call"
"""grand mal."""
"But if that were the case,"
"I ought to be seeing"
"the aftereffect on your EEG."
"And I'm not."
"This all looks"
"perfectly healthy."
"Also a tonic-clonic is generally"
"followed by a postictal phase..."
"deep sleep, confusion, amnesia..."
"but it sounds like"
"you just popped up,"
"more or less, and came on in."
"Anything else going on"
"in your life?"
"New or out of the ordinary?"
"She's been playing a new sim."
"VR, you mean?"
"Uh..."
"it's a little more elaborate"
"than that."
"Sort of a full-body experience."
"New sort of headset."
"What's it called?"
"The new tech."
"I can check and see"
"if there have been any studies."
"I don't believe"
"it has a name yet."
"Well, where's it from?"
"Colombian company."
"It's kind of a long story,"
"actually."
"Okay."
"Well, stop using it."
"That seems like a no-brainer."
"To use a technical term."
"I'll run your blood work,"
"get you in for a CT scan"
"at the Hefty Mart."
"Sure."
"And in the meantime, rest,"
"fluids, all that good stuff."
"Call me if there's"
"anything unusual."
"And by ""anything,"""
"I mean anything."
"All right?"
"Sure thing, Dee Dee."
"Thank you."
"Oh, and, Burton,"
"will you do me a favor"
"and send me the contact info"
"for your Colombian company?"
"I wanna call them"
"about that headset."
"Trick or treat!"
"I think she might've meant all headsets, Flynne."
"Jesus."
"Yeah, she might've meant"
"all headsets,"
"but she sure as hell"
"didn't say that."
"What are you gonna do"
"about that anyway?"
"Her asking us what the name"
"of the company is and all."
"Dodge and delay."
"My most impressive skill set,"
"some might argue."
"I knew we shouldn't have"
"told her."
"She's got a lot coming at her,"
"running that clinic."
"Which'll do wonders to erode"
"a person's attention span."
"What are you playing?"
"Nothing actually."
"Just watching a..."
"home movie."
"Which one?"
"One of the old ones."
"Mm."
"Hey, listen, uh..."
"I'm sorry."
"For what?"
"You're getting"
"a f*cking brain scan."
"We can start there."
"And then we can keep going,"
"I imagine,"
"till I run out of things"
"I need to apologize for."
"Yeah, but, Burton,"
"Mama's seeing again."
"Want to apologize for that, too?"
"Talking about you here, Flynne."
"I've been to London, Burton."
"Hell, I visited the future."
"None of the bad stuff"
"happening right now..."
"...none of it can hold a candle"
"to what it's like to go there."
"You have no idea"
"how magical it is."
"So it's fine, okay? Don't worry."
"You don't need to say sorry."
"I'm not saying"
"you shouldn't do it."
"But if you're gonna do it,"
"you better have a good argument"
"for the doing it."
"And by ""good,"" I mean not just,"
"""I want to see what it's like."""
"But I do want to see"
"what it's like."
"I get that, and I wouldn't"
"mind seeing myself,"
"but we can't afford"
"having you end up on your back,"
"kicking your heels against the"
"floor and frothing at the mouth."
"Given the unknown contingencies"
"we've been encountering"
"in the here and now."
"If this sh*t is harming Flynne,"
"then someone's got to go there"
"and knock those assholes"
"back on their f*cking heels."
"I mean, they got these"
"cool things called phones."
"I mean in person, Leon."
"I think that's"
"the wrong way to put it,"
"but I-I get what you're saying."
"Physically."
"In a body."
"Slamming up against theirs,"
"if need be."
"She's scheduled any minute."
"Now's the time."
"Surprise the f*cking sh*t out of 'em."
"I hate to keep saying this"
"'cause it seems like"
"you don't want to hear it,"
"but if you end up WIA,"
"we're all..."
"She's got a body"
"when she goes in there?"
"A real one?"
"I'm so sorry."
"For?"
"Disturbing you."
"Inexcusable, isn't it?"
"Interrupting me"
"whilst I sip my tea?"
"You have"
"a strikingly feline manner"
"slinking about the house, Wilf."
"Always slipping"
"out of rooms when I appear."
"I'll confess I always"
"found it rather unappealing."
"Your constant slipping away."
"Seemed like"
"a form of shiftiness,"
"as if you couldn't be trusted."
"But then quite by chance,"
"Lev and I went slumming it"
"one night at SHUM."
"And we saw you there dancing."
"And then I realized what"
"I'd taken for sneaking about"
"was actually"
"just a form of dancing."
"A way of skirting free"
"from any entanglement."
"Because that's what you fear,"
"isn't it?"
"Someone getting hold of you?"
"Literally or metaphorically?"
"Dance with me."
"I'm sorry?"
"Indulge me."
"Just for a moment."
"And I'll stop tormenting you."
"I promise."
"â™ª You can't read my mind â™ª"

"So sorry. Did I startle you?"
"You obviously put a tad"
"too much faith"
"in your perimeter monitor."
"May I?"
"I wouldn't ordinarily"
"drop by unannounced,"
"but I wanted"
"to grab a rare moment"
"of privacy with you, Lev."
"May I call you Lev?"
"May I call you Cherise?"
"I prefer not."
"You stole something from me."
"I don't know what you mean."
"Aelita West."
"How much were you paying her?"
"If someone, theoretically,"
"stole something."
"One would think"
"that you would go to the police."
"Unless, you didn't want the Met"
"to find out about this"
"theoretically stolen thing."
"Hmm?"
"What is it you're missing,"
"by the way?"
"You see now,"
"I'd accuse you of playing dumb,"
"but you seem to be forgetting"
"quite a bit of"
"vital information recently,"
"including the realpolitik"
"that governs us all."
"So..."
"let's you and I have"
"a quick review, shall we?"
"We live in a house"
"with three walls."
"The Klept oligarchy,"
"through the application"
"of extreme violence,"
"managed to bring order"
"from the chaos of the Jackpot."
"And now, in exchange"
"for rather an open hand"
"and blind eye when it comes"
"to the free pursuit of profit,"
"it helps to maintain that order."
"The Met Police keeps the Klept"
"from straying beyond certain"
"implicit boundaries."
"The Research Institute"
"benefits from the peace"
"and prosperity that results,"
"and in turn provides a"
"technical assistance for society"
"to function and thrive."
"It's a wondrous edifice"
"we've managed to construct."
"But it's also rather fragile,"
"I'm afraid."
"And what's the roof meant to be?"
"It's a metaphor."
"Oh."
"For the thing that will"
"come crashing down on all of us"
"should one of the walls"
"overstep its bounds."
"In other words..."
"the end of the world, Lev."
"Oh, dear."
"Mm."
"Your description of the Klept"
"left a bit out."
"You mentioned the ""application"
"of extreme violence."""
"There was no shortage of that"
"in the Jackpot certainly."
"But the Klept simply succeeded"
"where others failed"
"through a sort of"
"atavistic tribal unity."
"Strike one of us, strike us all."
"And suffer accordingly."
"I'm sure that you could"
"express this all"
"far more eloquently than I can,"
"using my toast as a prop."
"What were you watching"
"when I walked up?"
"My wife,"
"as I'm sure you're aware,"
"is a member of"
"the Zolotov family."
"Apex predators in the Klept"
"world, you might say."
"So if Dominika wishes to play"
"with a family pet,"
"who am I to question her?"
"Is that how you view"
"Mr. Netherton?"
"I'm rather fond of my pets."
"Far more reliable"
"than my friends."
"Yuri Samsonov was a friend once."
"Wasn't he?"
"Poor Yuri."
"Such a tragic fate."
"But also rather"
"a relevant example"
"in terms of"
"our three-walled house."
"You see,"
"Yuri Samsonov overstepped."
"The Met Police"
"resolved the problem"
"with the technical assistance"
"of the RI, but..."
"it was the Klept"
"who handed Yuri over."
"Someone he trusted."
"A kiss to the cheek."
"Do you know how"
"the RI accomplished the task?"
"An assembler swarm."
"Tweaked to seek out"
"Samsonov DNA."
"An entire lineage"
"eaten away to nothing."
"Your thoughts, Lev,"
"I can... sense them."
"Can you now?"
"I hope so."
"I hope you're thinking,"
"""My, what a powerful weapon."
"And it's just been sitting"
"in the RI all these years,"
"waiting for"
"the next sample of DNA."""
"Think on that, Lev."
"Have a lovely day."
"What's he up to, Wilf?"
"No more dancing away."
"Now you can be my ally here"
"or my enemy."
"Your choice."
"But I assure you"
"it's not an easy path to walk,"
"being my enemy."
"Flynne?"
"Who the f*ck are you?"
"Ossian, get up here. Now!"
"What's happening?"
"f*cking polts."
"Hacked the connection."
"Flynne?"
"Friend of the brother's."
"The triple amputee."
"Heading for the gates."
"You okay, buddy?"
"Hey, hey, Conner!"
"Conner?"
"We're with you, man."
"We're right here."
"What do you need?"
"Tell us what to do."
"Send me back."
"Send me back."
"Trick or treat!"
"This is a private space,"
"Mr. Netherton."
"I don't remember"
"inviting you here."
"I had no idea."
"Ash arranged it."
"I'm very sorry."
"I wanted to address"
"some issues that have arisen."
"May I?"
"Sure."
"What is this?"
"It's a home movie."
"My mother filmed it."
"There's a company"
"that takes them"
"and turns them"
"into sims like this."
"That you?"
"Me, Burton,"
"and that's my dad."
"Your father's wearing your jacket?"
"No."
"I'm wearing his."
"Burton looks like him."
"Oh, yeah,"
"and he is more"
"than a little bit conceited"
"on that fact."
"It's a cultural trait,"
"I gather,"
"from your part of the world,"
"to mock the ones you love?"
"What makes you think that I love him?"
"You don't?"
"Of course I do."
"It's my brother."
"I'd do anything for him."
"Do you have any siblings?"
"A sister."
"Then I imagine"
"you probably understand."
"So what are these issues"
"that have arisen?"
"Your friend made a visit."
"Conner."
"What?"
"It's true."
"In your Peripheral."
"He informed us of your seizure."
"f*ck."
"Which he seems to believe"
"the headset caused."
"And I bet you're here"
"to tell me it didn't."
"Well, I have no idea if it did."
"You know, that might be"
"the only time that I'm..."
"100% sure"
"that you didn't just lie to me."
"Well..."
"Wilfred."
"I looked that up, by the way."
"It means, ""He who wants peace."""
"You know that?"
"I looked"
"some other stuff up, too."
"Didn't find very much,"
"except a Lev Zubov."
"That exists in my time."
"But I imagine it's a common name"
"where your boss comes from."
"What did you find?"
"Mafia thing."
"Him, his wife, his children,"
"daughters, sons,"
"they were all murdered, shot."
"The house was set on fire."
"Pretty gruesome stuff."
"But no connection to your Lev?"
"None at all."
"Mm."
"Get your scan."
"In the meantime,"
"we'll investigate the headset."
"We'll only ask you"
"to return if it's safe."
"I give you my word."
"You and your word, huh?"
"I mean it."
"The truth twice"
"in one conversation."
"Be careful now, Wilf,"
"it might become a habit."
"There's one thing"
"I haven't shared."
"Aelita."
"She's my sister."
"Da?"
"I'm here to see Lev Zubov."
"Please put this on, sir."
"Was that absolutely necessary?"
"Some of the club's"
"more elderly members"
"don't take kindly to being"
"glimpsed by interlopers."
"I take it you have"
"good cause for this intrusion?"
"I, um... I met with our polt."
"She shared"
"some unexpected information."
"Y-Your family in the stub."
"All of them."
"They were killed."
"A few weeks ago."
"Brutally."
"No."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"I-I... It's just that I can..."
"forget how kind"
"you actually are."
"Maybe you do, too."
"Makes me worry for you a bit."
"That softness under the shell."
"Someone targeted them, Lev."
"Someone from here, I presume."
"What do you think I was"
"paying Aelita to do for me?"
"I have no idea."
"You made it quite clear that"
"you don't consider it"
"any of my business."
"We wanted to learn"
"how to open a stub of our own."
"Why would the Klept want a stub?"
"Why would we want anything?"
"There's money to be made."
"In a stub? How?"
"The only limit is"
"one's imagination."
"And morals, I suppose."
"For example?"
"My brother Alexei purchased"
"a pharmaceutical concern."
"Even with AI, at some point,"
"one has to test a new drug"
"on a human population."
"It's a process"
"that medical ethics"
"could make rather tedious."
"And costly."
"So you tested it out in a stub?"
"Yes, that's just a for instance."
"As I said,"
"the possibilities are..."
"essentially infinite."
"But one thing"
"troubled me, though."
"The idea of different versions"
"of myself in another world."
"The existential nihilism of it."
"I just couldn't abide it."
"You killed your family?"
"No, no, no."
"Not personally,"
"no, of course not."
"No, I transferred funds and"
"hired the appropriate personnel."
"And I'll tell you"
"something, Wilf."
"I felt better."
"Instantly."
"In fact,"
"once we gain the ability"
"to open these things ourselves,"
"it'll always be"
"the first task I'll address."
"I would offer"
"to take care of your lineage,"
"but I realize your origins"
"are a bit..."
"murkier."
"Was there anything else"
"you wanted to share?"
"No."
"Better put"
"that silly thing back on"
"and be on your way."
"What about,"
"uh, Ms. Oswald?"
"Ms. Perry? Ms. Travantine?"
"Algebra Ms. Perry"
"or Chemistry Ms. Perry?"
"sh*t. I forgot about"
"Chemistry Ms. Perry."
"Never took her."
"Can't even picture her."
"Aw, sh*t, Burton."
"The ""f*ck"" is easy, ain't it?"
"Ms. Travantine, huh?"
"Copy that."
"Goddamn."
"And then, I guess"
"I'd marry Ms. Oswald."
"She's like 90, man."
"Yeah, I know, but..."
"Ms. Perry's the one"
"who got me to join up."
"Said I'd regret it if I didn't."
"Chance to do"
"some good, see the world,"
"all that bullsh*t."
"Gave me a whole f*cking speech."
"I thought that was your speech."
"Yeah, I took it from her."
"Gave it to you"
"and those other fools."
"Okay. She's definitely"
"the ""kill."""
"A person with manners"
"might knock."
"That same theoretical person"
"might be a little scared off"
"by that weird-ass game"
"you two were playing."
"Probably wouldn't be"
"eavesdropping, though,"
"would she?"
"I'm not so sure they would not be rude enough"
"to eavesdrop."
"Would you two both shut the f*ck up?"
"Please?"
"Thank you."
"Is there a reason you're here,"
"or you just want to piss me off?"
"I'm looking"
"for advice, actually."
"You know this Aelita woman?"
"The one that hired us"
"in the first place."
"Well, we finally found out"
"where she was living."
"And she had this..."
"this diorama thing of our house."
"This trailer."
"And of y'all."
"Like these little..."
"toy soldiers."
"Leon, Reece, Carlos."
"All of y'all."
"Your whole unit."
"So I guess I'm just wondering:"
"What the hell"
"do I do with all that?"
"They said it was a sim."
"When they sent the headset."
"And?"
"Never saw one"
"you couldn't master."
"That's the thing, Burton."
"This ain't just another sim."
"But you thought it was."
"What if you kept thinking it?"
"Like Conner with his chessboard."
"He makes these moves"
"that set everything in motion."
"What do you call 'em?"
"Gambit."
"Gambits, yep."
"What's your gambit, Flynne?"
"What's the first thing"
"you do when you get in a sim?"
"Break script."
"Do the exact opposite"
"of what's expected."
"And what happens?"
"I die a bunch."
"Look pretty stupid."
"And then?"
"I figure out the rule set."
"And then?"
"I take control."
"f*ck yeah."
"Easy Ice."
"Let's do that."
"You and me go in there."
"Start dying."
"Not without me,"
"motherf*ckers, not this time."
"More boots we got on the ground,"
"the less likely we are to get"
"our asses kicked in there."
"That's just basic tactics,"
"ain't it?"
"You are so full of sh*t, Burton."
"You just want to see it."
"And what if I do?"
"Besides, it doesn't matter"
"'cause you're not"
"going back in there"
"till we get"
"your seizure sorted out."
"It's all sorted."
"It ain't sorted"
"till we see the scan."
"I feel fine."
"I want to go back, Burton."
"Okay? I need to."
"So you go on ahead"
"and call Macon and Edward."
"It's not like"
"we got time to waste."
"How long do you think"
"it's gonna be"
"till someone else comes around"
"wanting to kill us?"
"How's your hand?"
"Everything's back to normal."
"Okay? I told you."
"I'll get you bodies."
"Both of you."
"What's wrong?"
"Where's your father?"
"Flynne? The children."
"Inside. Now."
"Am I being used as a toy"
"when I'm not here?"
"They needed a fourth."
"It seemed harmless enough,"
"but I apologize."
"What are you doing here?"
"How long does it take to make"
"one of these?"
"Why?"
"'Cause I need one. For Conner."
"Another one for Burton, too."
"Where are you going?"
"You see, sim jockeys"
"tend to have a specialty."
"Achievers, Explorers, Killers."
"I'm an Explorer, Ash, so I think"
"now's a pretty good time"
"to start."
"Cut her connection."
"Working on it, luv."
"But the polts are countering."
"Rather adeptly, I'm afraid."
"She's leaving."
"Best follow, don't you think?"
"Where in the bloody hell"
"is Zubov?"
"Wherever he is,"
"he won't be happy"
"to hear our polt's"
"gone a'wandering."
"If the Met Police"
"encounter her again,"
"this could be the end of us."
"And I mean all of us, luv."
"Alert him."
"This is"
"really quite stupid, Flynne."
"If you want a tour of the city,"
"I can happily..."
"Show me exactly what you"
"want me to see? No, thank you."
"That's not really exploring,"
"now, is it?"
"Maybe you can explain"
"the point of this exploring."
"I want to see all the sh*t"
"you haven't been showing me."
"I assure you,"
"there is absolutely nothing..."
"Damn it, look me in the eye"
"when you say it."
"I want to see the expression you"
"make when you lie to my face."
"Apologies for the interruption,"
"Mr. Zubov,"
"but we have a situation"
"that is turning somewhat urgent."
"The polt has made"
"an unscheduled visit."
"Mr. Netherton's assistance"
"may be in order."
"I'll send him"
"straight there."
"Not here, I'm afraid."
"More-more toward Paddington"
"at the moment."
"Though this appears"
"to be rather fluid."
"Oh, for f*ck's sake,"
"Ossian, cut her connection."
"Aye, sir. Brilliant idea."
"And-and-and we're working on it,"
"but in the, in the meantime,"
"if you could just dispatch"
"Mr. Netherton..."
"Oh, you f*cking prat!"
"Not you, sir."
"You don't need to do that."
"Yes I do, Edward."
"You're overcomplicating this"
"as usual."
"You just got to keep him at bay."
"I'm aware how a hacker battle"
"works, okay? I never lost."
"Move. Move."
"No, man, you don't know"
"what to do."
"Get out my way."
"If you simply tell me..."
"Aelita told me I'm likely"
"to die in ten years, Ash."
"What do you think"
"she meant by that?"
"And where are all the people?"
"Done?"
"Did you not hear"
"my roar of victory"
"echoing across the rooftops?"
"""Victory at all costs."
"Victory in spite of the..."""
"Return to the Zubov residence."
"What about...?"
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
"Hey, Burton? Yeah."
"Tell her to shut her eyes."
"Shut them now!"
"That sneaky little prick."
"Come on, move, move out of the way."
"What? Wait, I got to..."
"Come on, I told you you'd f*ck this up."
"Back again, are we?"
"What happened"
"to the people, Ash?"
"You're certain"
"this is the place?"
"According to Ossian."
"Head through the gate"
"and bear right."
"We call it the Jackpot."
"It wasn't one thing."
"Or all at once."
"It was everything together."
"Building over time."
"Even now, they're still arguing"
"about when it technically began."
"It's started, though?"
"Already in my time?"
"Yes."
"Nice place for a stroll."
"She has a right to know,"
"Mr. Netherton."
"A moral right."
"Send me the damn code."
"What is this?"
"Our past, your future."
"A museum of sorts."
"Each of these shapes represents"
"a different phase"
"of the Jackpot."
"Why ""the Jackpot""?"
"Gallows humor, I suppose."
"And it's less portentous"
"than ""Apocalypse."""
"This is the moment"
"commonly pinpointed"
"as the edge of the cliff."
"After which"
"there is no turning back."
"The Jackpot was unstoppable."
"A hack of the North American"
"electrical grid."
"Complete blackout."
"Monthslong, continent-wide."
"An increasingly common"
"phenomenon, as it turned out."
"Across the globe."
"That's just seven years off"
"in my world."
"Pandemic."
"A filovirus."
"We called it the Blood Plague."
"It attacked the viscera."
"The liver, spleen, intestines"
"filling with blood"
"till the abdomen burst."
"Environmental"
"catastrophe."
"Droughts. Famine."
"Antibiotic failure."
"Agricultural collapse"
"followed."
"Full population collapse."
"Bit more than"
"seven billion people."
"Over four decades or so."
"And then came the end."
"A domestic terrorist attack"
"in the United States."
"They blew up"
"a nuclear missile silo."
"Spring Creek, North Carolina."
"Jesus Christ."
"That's where I live."
"Geez, just make it stop."
"You okay?"
"You get us bodies?"
"Um..."
"I'm working on it."
"There are moments when"
"fate can go one way or another."
"Thousand ways it could"
"have gone wrong back there."
"Can't dwell"
"on the past, Flynne."
"What mysteries"
"do you oversee,"
"down there in your secret burrow"
"with the big steel door?"
"It's getting real hard"
"to keep this under wraps."
"I'm starting"
"to trust you."
"Is that a mistake?"
"A Neoprimitive."
"Someone who believes"
"that we've ruined the world"
"by trying to save it."
"Your family,"
"they were killed brutally."
"This is all quite distressing."
"You want to kill him, don't you?"
"Oh, very much so."
"You can be"
"my ally or my enemy."
"I assure you,"
"it's not easy being my enemy."
"Anything"
"going on in your life,"
"new or out of the ordinary?"
"Whoa."
"Jesus."
"I missed you, too."
"What are you doing?"
"Just saying hello."
"Shall I review?"
"I prefer to live face forward."
"Ass to the past. Let bygones"
"be bygones, and all that."
"I tried to greet you"
"on my first day here,"
"and you cut me dead."
"Yeah."
"Oh, yeah, and then there was"
"that charming letter"
"on my desk the next morning."
"I still have it somewhere,"
"if you'd like me"
"to quote verbatim."
"Off the top of my head,"
"without immediate"
"recourse to the text:"
"""If you ever f*cking"
"speak to me again,"
"I will scratch your eyes out,"
"you selfish, conniving bitch."""
"It was ""c*nt,"" I believe."
"Bitch. I'm quite certain."
"Well, it seems"
"like I would've gone"
"with the alliteration"
"of ""conniving c*nt."""
"Another missed opportunity."
"Yeah, like this one,"
"if you walk away."
"Chance to have a drink,"
"old times' sake?"
"I'm married."
"Well, belated congratulations."
"What's she like?"
"He."
"Oh, Grace."
"Say it is not so."
"I have two children."
"f*ck."
"You poor thing."
"Was it a stipulation?"
"You broke my f*cking heart."
"â™ª I'm a fool to want you â™ª"
"â™ª I'm a fool to want you..."
"One drink,"
"and then I'm off."
"So whatever you want to say,"
"I suggest you get"
"straight to it."
"I just thought it was time"
"for an after-action review."
"Which makes it sound"
"like a firefight."
"It wasn't?"
"â™ª True â™ª"
"â™ª A love that's there â™ª"
"â™ª For others, too â™ª"
"â™ª I'm a fool to hold you..."
"I saw an AI therapist for a bit."
"After things fell apart with us."
"And is that"
"how you presented the matter?"
"That things just ""fell apart""?"
"It said the allure..."
"and the fatal flaw..."
"of our relationship"
"was that you were"
"a bad good-girl,"
"and I was a good bad-girl."
"On the surface, you make"
"a show of being rather bad,"
"but deep down, you're almost"
"frighteningly good."
"And I'm the opposite."
"And did you pay"
"for that drivel"
"with actual money?"
"It helped me."
"Quite a bit."
"Do you still muck about"
"with those doll's houses?"
"Not for years."
"The AIT had a theory."
"It said it was all about"
"order and control."
"That you came from a place"
"where you had neither,"
"and the doll's houses were"
"a way to compensate."
"Miniature worlds in which"
"you could feel safe."
"That sounds like a steaming"
"pile of horsesh*t."
"You have"
"a better explanation?"
"You have to admit"
"it's an eccentric hobby."
"Do you ever find it difficult"
"to understand people?"
"You know, what they're thinking,"
"what they're feeling?"
"Empathy, you mean?"
"There's something about"
"taking a tiny figure"
"and shifting it about."
"Arranging how it's sitting."
"What it's looking at."
"And it made me feel"
"like I had access"
"into another being's inner..."
"inner life."
"And that can feel"
"rather priceless."
"â™ª To want you â™ª"
"â™ª Pity me, I need you..."
"You gonna kiss me?"
"Is that what you want?"
"â™ª I know it's wrong..."
"I have f*cking"
"missed you, Aelita."
"You have no idea how much."
"Mm. You should've"
"treated me better."
"You-you want an apology?"
"Is-is that it?"
"No."
"Water under the bridge."
"Swept out to sea long ago."
"What, then?"
"Tell me about your job."
"My job?"
"Yeah."
"What mysteries do you oversee,"
"down there in your secret burrow"
"with the big steel door?"
"You don't want to hear about that."
"No, I do."
"I do."
"...like a giant"
"petri dish, really."
"We can do anything we want here."
"Well, we are doing"
"anything we want."
"And it's real?"
"You're certain of that?"
"Boggles the mind, doesn't it?"
"See, we're told"
"it's like a simulation."
"An elaborate..."
"That's how we're instructed"
"to explain it."
"The data we send down"
"to you lower-echelon types."
"Lower-echelon types?"
"All right."
"And, uh, how many"
"people have access?"
"Just my team."
"And Dr. Nuland, of course."
"As well as the upper tier"
"security personnel."
"So maybe two dozen?"
"You ready?"
"We call it the God font."
"I can access anything here."
"And not just"
"from the stub, either,"
"but from the R.I."
"in its entirety."
"But our data culls..."
"that's just a grain of sand"
"on a larger beach."
"We're actively altering"
"conditions in the stub."
"We have over"
"8,000 studies running."
"Researching what?"
"It would be difficult to name"
"a field without a foothold."
"Botany, meteorology,"
"zoology, genetics,"
"oceanography,"
"robotics, forestry..."
"But the truly exciting stuff,"
"the hush-hush,"
"saving-the-world sh*t?"
"That comes from our"
"Behavioral Mod Department."
"They set up a shell"
"company in the stub"
"which bid on a contract"
"with the American military"
"to install haptic implants"
"in personnel."
"Our tech, more or less,"
"but on an appropriately"
"primitive level."
"To what end?"
"Watch. This one's fun."
"Let's say we have"
"a group of elite Marines"
"at a remote outpost."
"They've been told"
"enemy forces are planning"
"to use injured animals"
"to draw them into the open."
"So, what would these"
"highly trained young men do"
"if a wounded dog were to appear"
"in front of their position?"
"Shoot it."
"But..."
"if our implants subtly goosed"
"the subjects' neural chemistry,"
"increasing electrical activity"
"in the anterior insular cortex?"
"Oh. The, uh, compassion center."
"Okay."
"Which one?"
"All of them."
"Now, that's where it gets"
"really interesting."
"You see, they all"
"react differently,"
"based on their..."
"their personal histories,"
"their life experiences."
"The mystery of character."
"Is he..."
"Wait for it."
"Stop him."
"Stop him."
"It's already happened, luv."
"Long ago."
"I mean, you can imagine"
"the implications."
"Implementing"
"a similar modification"
"on a societal level."
"I mean, say goodbye"
"to mob violence."
"Say goodbye to..."
"You can't do that."
"I mean, they're people."
"They're real people."
"You see?"
"So frighteningly good."
"Is she planning on implementing"
"something like that here?"
"Would you believe me"
"if I said no?"
"Has she already?"
"Again,"
"would you believe me if I said no?"
"Good evening."
"Wait."
"You're from Grains and Legumes?"
"Yeah, that's right."
"Would you mind"
"explaining"
"your presence here,"
"where you assuredly have"
"no f*cking right to be?"
"I'm sorry?"
"You lack clearance"
"for this floor."
"Oh, um, I was just..."
"You know who I am?"
"Of course, Dr. Hogart."
"Well, then,"
"perhaps you can explain why"
"you're addressing an old and"
"rather dear friend of mine"
"in such an unacceptably"
"rude manner?"
"I am simply doing my job, ma'am."
"Her presence on this floor"
"would seem to require an..."
"We met upstairs."
"But I forgot my jacket."
"So I brought her"
"back down with me."
"Under my supervision"
"and as my guest."
"You may file a report"
"on the matter, if you wish."
"But please take care"
"to sign your name."
"So I'll know who to address"
"my grievance against."
"I don't think that will be"
"necessary, Doctor."
"But I will ask that"
"you not do this again."
"Excuse me."
"I-I just want to say you have"
"the most extraordinary eyes."
"Seriously."
"I..."
"I'd kill for eyes like that."
"â™ª What a day for a daydream â™ª"
"â™ª What a day for"
"a daydreamin' boy â™ª"
"â™ª And I'm lost in a daydream â™ª"
"â™ª Dreamin' 'bout"
"my bundle of joy â™ª"
"â™ª And even if time"

"Robert O'Connell,"
"pleasure to make"
"your acquaintance."
"$10 million, Bob."
"Twenty-five percent"
"has already been deposited"
"into your account."
"That's how much"
"I believe in you."
"Name's"
"not Bob, pal. It's Pete."
"Why is it so bloody difficult to"
"get you people to take my money?"
"I haven't got the slightest idea"
"what you're talking about."
"I'm talking about"
"Bob the Butcher O'Connell."
"I don't know who that is."
"Dublin lad."
"Made his name"
"killing three UDA fighters"
"on the eve of his 18th birthday."
"Racked up quite"
"an impressive body count"
"before fleeing the country."
"Do you ever count them up"
"in the night, Bob?"
"All those poor souls"
"you've cut free"
"from their fleshly prisons?"
"Who the f*ck is this?"
"Your new employer."
"I tried a hammer,"
"and it didn't work."
"So I'm looking for"
"a better tool."
"A scalpel, if you will."
"You've been both in your time,"
"haven't you, Bob?"
"Seriously, buddy."
"You got the wrong number."
"Well, I guess I must have"
"Tommy Giorno's number wrong,"
"too, then."
"Which is a shame, because I was"
"planning on calling him next."
"Maybe tell him"
"about your daughter."
"In that little bungalow of hers."
"Baton Rouge, isn't it?"
"Do I have"
"your attention now, Bob?"
"Who do"
"you want dead?"
"All right, Flynne."
"You ready?"
"Yeah."
"Yeah!"
"Oh, baby!"
"Frank's back in the house."
"Okay, who's up?"
"I think it's Tony."
"Let's go."
"Bring 'em home, Tony."
"I didn't get up there."
"All right, buddy,"
"you got this."
"You got it. All right."
"Back in a sec."
"Okay."
"Beer, Janet."
"And one for my friend."
"There you are."
"Looking pretty fit"
"for an old man."
"Takes more effort"
"than it used to,"
"that's for sure."
"Like everything else."
"You surprised to see me?"
"Figured you might pop up."
"Not here, though."
"This is a bad play, Bobby."
"You know how I am."
"Always a sucker"
"for the long odds."
"My boys."
"Looks like they're all grown up."
"The years rush by, don't they?"
"My daughter,"
"she's all grown up, too."
"I might've let it slide,"
"Frank, you know,"
"for old time's sake,"
"if you'd left her out of it."
"The way the guy laid it out..."
"Who?"
"I don't know. Voice on the phone."
"Some Brit."
"He said it was you or me."
"Girls, go freshen up."
"I ain't proud"
"of myself, Bobby."
"I'm f*cking ashamed"
"is what I am."
"Mr. O'Connell?"
"Holy sh*t."
"Yeah, we thought it was you."
"That's enough, folks."
"Give us a minute, boys."
"We've got some things to talk about."
"No."
"I think we'll walk"
"Mr. O'Connell to his car."
"What do you say, Bob?"
"I loved you"
"like a brother, Frank."
"Gun, gun, gun!"
"â™ª 'Cause I know we can â™ª"
"â™ª Let's make it something"
"to shout about â™ª"
"â™ª Come on and take my hand â™ª"
"â™ª 'Cause I got the love â™ª"
"â™ª Got the love,"
"got the love â™ª"
"â™ª And I got to make it"
"work on you â™ª"
"â™ª Got the love, got the love â™ª"
"â™ª Uh, uh â™ª"
"â™ª Got the love,"
"got the love â™ªâ™ª"
"Mr. O'Connell."
"I know the what."
"The why doesn't matter."
"The how is what"
"you're paying me for."
"I need a where"
"and a when to get it done."
"Your targets will be here"
"tomorrow morning"
"for a medical procedure"
"that should take"
"no longer than an hour."
"What type of procedure?"
"A spinal tap."
"After which, they'll return"
"to their residence,"
"here."
"The rest I leave to you, Bob."
"For f*ck's sake."
"Oh, no."
"Could've just stayed"
"inside, son, you know?"
"Pretended to be dead."
"Tell you what I'm gonna do."
"I'm gonna get in this car here."
"And if I can get it to start"
"after your little fusillade,"
"then I'll be gone."
"Now, if you can manage"
"to crawl free before that,"
"I'll consider us even."
"For your father's sake."
"How does that sound?"
"I can't move my legs."
"That arm doesn't look"
"too great, either."
"Good luck."
"Oh, please."
"f*ck."
"f*ck! Don't!"
"What did you do, Jasper?"
"What?"
"Did I or did I not"
"explicitly tell you"
"not to take any of that money?"
"I didn't."
"So, this-this just"
"magically f*cking showed up"
"in your jacket pocket?"
"Whoa, babe."
"My uncle gave it to me."
"For what?"
"Huh?"
"Did you ask him"
"what he wanted in exchange?"
"Of-of course."
"I'm not a f*cking idiot."
"And?"
"He doesn't want nothing for it."
"It was just..."
"a gesture of gratitude"
"for all my years of hard work."
"Seriously, babe."
"No strings attached."
"That's it."
"Nothing's for free, Jasper."
"Well, I can give it back,"
"you want."
"No, no."
"I guess we can use it."
"Could've told me last night, though."
"I know."
"Saved me a panic attack this morning."
"I'm sorry."
"There's some coffee"
"left in the pot,"
"if you want it."
"Thanks."
"Have a good day."
"You're 100% sure about this?"
"Absolutely."
"It's bacterial."
"The oddest thing"
"I've ever encountered."
"Little bit like meningitis,"
"just extremely localized."
"In her occipital lobe."
"Which is what again?"
"It's basically"
"the part of the brain"
"involved in seeing."
"A lumbar puncture will"
"at least give us some idea"
"of what kind of bacteria you got"
"throwing a party in there."
"It looks scarier than it is."
"All right, you might feel"
"some pressure here."
"Mm-hmm."
"It shouldn't hurt at all,"
"but by all means, feel free"
"to hold your brother's hand."
"I won't judge."
"There."
"Wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Just peachy."
"Hello?"
"Ms. Andrews?"
"This is Derek Thompson of the"
"Appleview Insurance Company."
"I'm sorry to bother you,"
"but I'm afraid we've had"
"to cancel your policy."
"When is this change effective?"
"Immediately, I'm afraid."
"I'd make other arrangements"
"as soon as possible."
"And with great care."
"My husband and I"
"had hoped to continue our"
"relationship with Appleview."
"I-If we can?"
"I'm afraid that might"
"not be possible, ma'am."
"There's a chance Appleview"
"may be closing its doors soon."
"For good."
"Jesus, Dad."
"But I want to say"
"that we have valued"
"our relationship with you."
"More than you can"
"possibly know. I..."
"And we wish you and your husband"
"health and happiness in all things."
"I'm pregnant."
"Well... Well,"
"that's wonderful news, ma'am."
"Goodbye."
"And good luck."
"You all right, sir?"
"Just a bit of car trouble."
"I'll be fine, thanks."
"You want me to take a look?"
"Well, that's awfully kind"
"of you, young lady."
"But, uh,"
"I've already called it in."
"Mechanic should be"
"along here any minute now."
"Who they sending?"
"Charlie Burr?"
"I don't believe"
"they gave me a name."
"Yeah, I'll bet it's Charlie."
"I could maybe save you whatever"
"ransom he'll end up charging."
"I appreciate it."
"But, uh..."
"I'll take my chances."
"This wouldn't be"
"one of those situations"
"where you're looking at me"
"and thinking"
"I can't fix a car"
"'cause I'm a woman, would it?"
"No, ma'am."
"I can take one look at you"
"and guess you'd know"
"your way around an engine."
"I honestly can't tell"
"if that's a compliment"
"or an insult."
"Oh,"
"I'd never waste an insult"
"on a stranger, young lady."
"I save them up"
"for friends and family."
"Okay. Well,"
"good luck to you, sir."
"Take care, now."
"Let-let me just take"
"a quick look on the off chance"
"I can one-up Charlie."
"I-I got some history with him,"
"which I won't bore you sharing,"
"but sending a little grief"
"his way would make my morning."
"You don't mind, do you?"
"I'd, uh, actually"
"just as soon wait."
"What happened?"
"Gravel truck overturned."
"Almost like getting hit"
"by buckshot."
"Not a pleasant experience,"
"I can assure you."
"Whoo-whee."
"You're having quite a day."
"You're telling me."
"And just getting started, too."
"Okay, I'm gonna give you"
"a friendly warning here, mister."
"If you let Burton Fisher"
"touch this engine"
"when you wouldn't let me,"
"I might have to just go"
"and shoot you both."
"Tell me you didn't run"
"into this man with that"
"tired-looking truck of yours,"
"Billy Ann."
"Just trying to be a Good Samaritan here, Burton."
"But some folks"
"can't seem to believe"
"a woman might know"
"how to fix a car."
"I think the young lady"
"simply misunderstood me."
"I, uh, I apologize"
"for all the fuss."
"I-I didn't mean to"
"offend anybody or I was, um..."
"I guess a bit flustered,"
"to be honest."
"Shoot him."
"Shoot him now."
"Get down!"
"sh*t."
"You okay?"
"Burton, Burton! sh*t."
"f*ck. I'm stuck. f*ck."
"You all right? Knife."
"f*ck. Burton!"
"Pretty good with a shotgun, too."
"Want to see?"
"Next one's in the head, old man."
"Flynne?"
"This what you do"
"to suspects, ain't it?"
"Break 'em up?"
"Talk to 'em one-on-one,"
"get the story straight?"
"Witnesses, too, Flynne."
"Now, what about victims, Tommy?"
"You, uh, you got any idea"
"what this is?"
"I don't know. Hell, I mean,"
"it looks like it's almost"
"something from the..."
"future, you know?"
"Yeah,"
"it does, don't it?"
"Well, he hasn't said a peep."
"No ID, no registration, nothing."
"But he is wearing a vest."
"And?"
"Makes it feel like he was"
"expecting a fight, don't it?"
"Sort of like Burton seems to be."
"Driving around, all geared up"
"like he's still off in Texas."
"Weapons, drones,"
"all ready to go?"
"If he wanted him dead, Tommy,"
"you know he would have done it."
"But he didn't."
"We called you instead."
"I know that."
"But I can't help thinking..."
"you know, a dead body"
"on this bridge?"
"Y'all got Homeland"
"Security showing up."
"Whereas just some bullets"
"flying, without a corpse?"
"Well, that remains"
"a local matter, now, don't it?"
"We're not doing"
"anything wrong, okay?"
"Promise you."
"You know what my first"
"memory of you is, Flynne?"
"My very first?"
"I was in the third grade."
"So you must've been in first."
"And they had you down at the"
"principal's office in a rage."
"Remember?"
"'Cause somehow,"
"you managed to take"
"all the earthworms"
"from the science room"
"and dumped them in the woods."
"Couldn't bear to have the fifth"
"graders dissecting them."
"Made quite the impression,"
"I'll tell you what."
"My uncle had a saying,"
"how people are"
"a lot like onions."
"One skin grows"
"over another, year by year."
"Which would mean"
"that little girl,"
"who freed all them worms..."
"...she's still inside you."
"And I can't help but feeling"
"I ought to protect her if I can."
"But I need your help."
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
"Guess you better, uh..."
"head on home."
"Flynne?"
"Talk to me, sweet pea."
"I don't know."
"Thousand ways it could have"
"gone wrong back there."
"Can't dwell"
"on the past, Flynne."
"Got to focus on"
"what's in front of us."
"How, Burton?"
"When they're always"
"about ten steps ahead of us?"
"He was posted up"
"on that bridge waiting for us."
"He knew that we'd come by."
"Let's just get you home."
"Safe and sound."
"Then we can talk about it."
"No need to censor"
"yourself around me, Burton."
"I know more than you think."
"Trips to the future."
"Men coming in the night"
"to attack you."
"And you sending Corbell Pickett"
"a bag full of cash."
"Then I guess you can see"
"how maybe there's a conflict"
"of interest at play here, Billy Ann?"
"I think we can agree"
"we're both interested"
"in Flynne's well-being."
"It's not you"
"I'm concerned about."
"If you're insulting Jasper,"
"you're insulting me."
"And I'd say what just"
"unfolded ought to buy me"
"a little trust"
"and a whole lot of respect."
"Jasper would never harm a soul."
"Let alone Flynne. Never."
"I'm a phone call away."
"Thank you."
"I didn't say nothing"
"that wasn't true, Flynne."
"Burton, she's a friend"
"of mine, okay?"
"And I'd like to think that"
"she's a friend of yours, too."
"Like it or not,"
"she's involved"
"in this now, okay?"
"It's getting real hard"
"to keep this under wraps."
"Billy Ann ain't the problem."
"Tommy and his sheriff"
"badge ain't the solution."
"We should have closed"
"that loop on the bridge."
"Yeah, well, you didn't."
"Where's Mama?"
"Mama? Leon?"
"Oh, no, Burton. The bodies."
"sh*t."
"I'm just struggling"
"to wrap my head around this."
"Medicine sent from the future."
"Just the formula for it."
"They sent it"
"to Pharma Jon to print."
"Sent how?"
"Does it matter, Mama?"
"It worked."
"Do you know why"
"your cousins grew up in Ohio?"
"'Cause Uncle Charles"
"lost their farm to the bank."
"My daddy told me"
"that story enough times"
"for me to grow impatient, too."
"But I also took it to heart."
"The idea that the worst thing"
"a person can do is grow"
"dependent on some outsider."
"All they care about is taking"
"something from your pocket"
"and putting it in theirs,"
"and on a regular basis, too."
"But we aren't"
"paying them anything."
"They're the ones paying us."
"That's what my Uncle"
"Charles must've thought,"
"when that loan money came in."
"They're giving me these drugs."
"What happens"
"if I stop taking them?"
"I don't know."
"What happens if you stop"
"paying Corbell Pickett?"
"Now I-I'm putting aside"
"all the traveling"
"to the future part"
"'cause I suppose I'll need"
"to think on that for a while"
"before I find"
"a way to accept it."
"But the dependency seems"
"simple enough."
"And it makes me"
"worry for all of us."
"Because I-I'm just getting"
"caught up here,"
"on all the complicated"
"ins and outs"
"of what you got going on."
"But if it looks to me"
"like you don't have"
"that much power"
"in your current arrangement,"
"think how it must look to them."
"We need"
"to talk this through."
"Burton, I'm done being"
"a sitting duck."
"We don't even know"
"if that headset is safe."
"And how safe is it here?"
"Sitting around, just waiting"
"for someone to come and get us?"
"Yes?"
"The polts have hacked"
"into the Peripheral."
"Do you want us to cut the connection?"
"No."
"This is a pleasant surprise."
"No, Wilf."
"A surprise is when someone"
"tries to kill you"
"out of the blue, which is"
"what just happened to me."
"A whole new person."
"And he had one of those"
"sonic punch things,"
"like the guy"
"from the Research Institute had."
"I didn't..."
"You were supposed to"
"let us know if somebody else"
"was coming to kill us."
"Except you can't only"
"not do that,"
"but you didn't even know"
"it happened after the fact."
"So much for your"
"living-in-the-future wisdom"
"bullsh*t, huh?"
"Flynne. What happened?"
"It's a f*cking mess now."
"The Sheriff's"
"Department's involved."
"There's gonna be a lot"
"of complications, Wilf."
"Is everyone okay?"
"I need to ask you something."
"The other day"
"when we went walking"
"and you linked up with me..."
"...did you have another motive?"
"I'm not sure I'm following."
"Were you trying to confuse me?"
"Or..."
"my emotions, I guess,"
"with the haptic drift stuff?"
"Haptic drift?"
"I-I don't know what that means."
"Wilf..."
"Did you merge with me"
"so I would start to..."
"...I don't know,"
"have feelings for you"
"that you hadn't"
"necessarily earned yet?"
"I'm sorry, Ms. Fisher."
"I honestly..."
"Wilf..."
"I'm starting to trust you."
"Is that a mistake?"
"No."
"No."
"How old are you, son?"
"I'm guessing 28 or so?"
"I don't read you as ex-military,"
"for some reason."
"You've probably"
"never left this town."
"Lived a nice, quiet life here,"
"I imagine."
"Well, that's over now."
"The quiet part, I mean."
"Though maybe"
"the living part, too,"
"depending on how this plays out."
"You believe there are"
"moments when fate"
"can go one way or another?"
"Like a fork in the road?"
"'Cause you're at one."
"Whether you know it or not."
"Now, you can take me"
"back the station."
"You can book me,"
"you can put my prints"
"in the system, swab my DNA,"
"and you set a clock ticking."
"On me, for certain."
"But on you, too."
"Because the people"
"who'll be coming for me, well,"
"they're not the sort"
"to leave loose ends untied."
"And me talking to you"
"like this, well..."
"I'm afraid that"
"makes you a loose end."
"Goddamn it."
"Look at your face."
"Don't you ever play poker."
"You're too transparent."
"I can see the curiosity"
"building up inside you."
"""Who the f*ck is this guy?"
"What's he doing,"
"coming round here"
"trying to kill these folks?"""
"Well, I'll tell you."
"Someone said they would"
"kill my daughter if I didn't."
"They also paid me $2.5 million."
"First installment"
"of an eventual ten,"
"if the job got done right."
"Which..."
"...it didn't, obviously."
"Who?"
"A voice on the phone."
"Doesn't matter who."
"What matters is"
"the $2.5 million."
"Which is yours..."
"...if you want it."
"What do you say, Deputy, huh?"
"I say..."
"f*ck."
"I fear"
"I've made a mistake,"
"agreeing to bring you here."
"I'm questioning"
"what you might hope"
"to achieve by going in there."
"I want Cherise to know"
"what it feels like."
"To be hunted."
"What? You don't think"
"I can handle her?"
"Oh, I have no doubt"
"you can handle her."
"It's the afterward"
"that concerns me."
"This isn't fending off"
"an attacker."
"It's being"
"the assailant yourself."
"Which carries"
"a far heavier weight."
"How would you even know?"
"You're always off in some corner"
"watching, aren't you?"
"Did I tell you"
"how I first met Lev?"
"When I was 12 years old,"
"my parents sent me"
"to boarding school."
"We were still crawling out"
"of the Jackpot at that point."
"And there were"
"some people who didn't like"
"the way power in"
"the new world was coalescing."
"They saw it as corrupt."
"What? Neoprims, you mean?"
"They attacked the school."
"Why? You were just kids."
"To send our parents a message."
"The Neoprims had me serve them"
"their food at the refectory."
"And they failed to notice"
"when I grabbed a steak knife"
"off one of their trays."
"I slashed their leader's throat."
"Then shot"
"his four companions dead."
"It was self-defense, Wilf."
"Even self-defense"
"can be cold-blooded."
"I didn't think of the weight..."
"...because I never"
"could have imagined it."
"Don't go over there."
"Unless you realize"
"what you might have to do."
"And you're at peace with it."
"How may I be of assistance?"
"Has my face been scanned?"
"Of course."
"That's all the assistance"
"I'm gonna need."
"Ma'am, if you don't have an appointment..."
"...I'm afraid I'll need"
"to call security."
"I think I can handle it"
"from here. Thank you."
"Hmm."
"I just assumed you'd be taller."
"I can only spare a minute, alas."
"So perhaps we ought to get"
"straight down to business."
"How can I be of help?"
"You mean, besides not"
"killing me and my family?"
"Well, exactly, because"
"that's rather nonnegotiable."
"The f*ck did I ever do to you?"
"Sticky fingers, dear."
"You absconded with"
"some rather vital data."
"Just return it,"
"and all shall be forgiven."
"I didn't take sh*t from you."
"I played my game and died."
"Got sent home. End game."
"So Aelita West still has it?"
"I don't know"
"who the f*ck has it."
"And quite frankly,"
"I don't give a sh*t."
"I just need you to leave me"
"and my family alone."
"You're either lying, or"
"expendable in your ignorance."
"Either way, your death"
"continues to be"
"my only viable goal."
"Now, what makes you"
"so certain I won't kill you?"
"Right here?"
"I mean,"
"I'm not that careless, dear."
"Now, I'm in"
"a Peripheral of my own."
"Ah, that doesn't mean I can't"
"deal you an awful lot of pain."
"Though I do imagine"
"you'd pop right out"
"of that thing"
"at the first sign of trouble."
"And why would you say that?"
"Now, you see, we got people"
"like you where I'm from."
"Folks with power, money,"
"love to walk all over"
"the rest of us."
"Not the kind to suffer through"
"anything close to a real fight."
"I've lived through"
"more extremity"
"than you could possibly imagine."
"It would crush"
"your tiny little mind."
"So please, don't care"
"to lecture me about pain."
"Oh, I don't want to lecture you."
"I just want to snap"
"your f*cking neck."
"Do you feel it?"
"The darkness closing in?"
"Let it be preparation"
"for when I kill you,"
"and it's real."
"Ah!"
"I got a foothold"
"in your world now."
"So next time, I'll be"
"coming for you instead."
"There's been a murder"
"involving a Peripheral."
"Well, I suppose"
"we best get busy."
"How come people here"
"stay so distant to us?"
"Do this."
"You're telling me"
"your invisible car's missing?"
"How hard did you hit"
"that pretty head of yours?"
"You almost got killed."
"Is there something else"
"you're not telling me?"
"Whatever you do,"
"don't lie to her."
"It wasn't an accident,"
"it was more like an ambush."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"I can access anything here,"
"but the truly exciting stuff"
"comes from our"
"Behavioral Mod Department."
"You can't do that."
"I mean, they're people."
"They're real people."
"You're so frighteningly good."
"Burton, I'm done"
"being a sitting duck."
"We don't even know"
"if that headset is safe."
"The oddest thing"
"I've ever encountered."
"And how safe"
"is it here,"
"sitting around, just waiting"
"for someone to come and get us?"
"Get down!"
"Pretty good with a shotgun, too."
"Want to see?"
"'Cause the people"
"who'll be coming for me, well..."
"they're not the sort"
"to leave loose ends untied."
"There's a pretty easy fix"
"for this."
"I ain't gonna shoot it, Burton."
"And if one of you idiots"
"goes ahead and tries,"
"I'll knock your f*cking"
"teeth out,"
"just so we're clear."
"Someone's got to do something,"
"'cause I can't take"
"much more of that sh*t."
"Intel says there's chatter"
"about the Tex-asses"
"using wounded dogs"
"to draw us into the open."
"And now here we are."
"With a f*cked-up dog"
"parked right in front of us."
"Seems pretty open-and-shut"
"to me, don't you think?"
"If there was somewhere"
"for a Tex-ass"
"to be hunkered down around here,"
"waiting on a Good Samaritan."
"Man, sniper three klicks away'd"
"take you out."
"Be dead before you even had"
"a chance to realize"
"how f*cking stupid you were."
"Three klicks might as well"
"be to the moon"
"with this sandy sh*t"
"they call air around here."
"Come on, baby boy."
"We ain't taken fire in 19 days."
"Just do something. Please?"
"Don't even think about it."
"Conner!"
"f*ck."
"Twelve o'clock."
"Son of a bitch."
"Movement. Two o'clock."
"That's a f*cking crow, Leon."
"f*ck's sake."
"Hey."
"Damn."
"All this sniper fire sure is"
"making it rough, ain't it?"
"Just get it done, motherf*cker."
"Hey there, champ."
"Let me just..."
"Oh, for f*ck's sake."
"I'm here, man. I'm right here."
"It's okay. It's okay."
"You're good."
"I'm here. I'm here, man."
"Okay?"
"It's all right, man."
"You do recall"
"I don't like to be interrupted"
"on my daily constitutional,"
"Beatrice?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"I assume this is"
"about the recent disturbance"
"at the Research Institute."
"Indeed, ma'am."
"In ten words or less, please."
"There's been a murder"
"in Sackville Street"
"involving a Peripheral"
"and a Koid."
"That's 14 words, Beatrice."
"Indeed, ma'am."
"Clarity seemed to require"
"the surfeit."
"And yet"
"so much remains unclear."
"How would you utilize"
"a more generous allotment?"
"I'd inform you that the victim"
"is the Research Institute's"
"head of security,"
"one Daniel Cook."
"I know Daniel."
"""Knew,"" ma'am, would be"
"the correct tense, I believe."
"Killed by a Koid?"
"Indeed."
"Throat slashed."
"It's lovely, isn't it?"
"Almost like a picture, ma'am."
"Don't be cheeky, Beatrice."
"It's not an endearing trait."
"Well, I suppose"
"we best get busy."
"I just don't see it, Tommy."
"But I put it in the log myself."
"Two days ago."
"Requisitioned a couple SUVs."
"With no plates and no color?"
"Cars were cloaked"
"with this chromatic tinting."
"I'm supposed to know"
"what that is?"
"It means they're invisible."
"You're telling me,"
"your invisible cars are missing?"
"How hard did you hit"
"that pretty head of yours?"
"Look, can I just get the keys"
"and check the lot myself?"
"You know I can't do that."
"Chain of custody."
"You want a peek?"
"Take that up"
"with Sheriff Jackman."
"Sheriff."
"Pretty damn certain"
"I sent you home, Tommy."
"Oh, just tying up"
"some loose ends, sir."
"Merciful heavens."
"Must've had a pretty special"
"guardian angel"
"looking after you, my friend."
"I, uh, read your report."
"Doesn't seem like you remember"
"much from the incident."
"That change at all?"
"Working through it"
"at the moment, sir."
"It's all a bit foggy."
"Mm-hmm."
"Looky here, Tommy, I'm gonna..."
"I'm gonna need you"
"to take some time off."
"Paid leave."
"You need to rest up,"
"get your head right."
"Come back to us swinging"
"for the fences, my friend."
"That man is loose"
"on my watch, sir."
"Oh, I'm well aware."
"And all that's gonna get sorted."
"I'm gonna see to it myself."
"You know, something I always"
"admired about you, Thomas."
"You got that fire in your belly."
"You always have,"
"ever since you was a teenager"
"running wild."
"Let me hit you"
"with a little bit of advice?"
"Learn how to control it."
"Too much of a good thing"
"is gonna burn you out."
"Like my granddaddy"
"used to tell me,"
"if you walking on eggs..."
"don't hop."
"You hear me, son?"
"Good man."
"I got some business of my own"
"to take care of."
"I'm embarrassed"
"to admit how anxious I was"
"when you vanished through"
"that door to confront Cherise."
"You're just a normal guy,"
"aren't you?"
"How do you mean?"
"I don't know,"
"I look at you and..."
"I look at all this..."
"It's just so different"
"from where I live."
"Or when, I guess."
"And you think"
"that it'd be better, but..."
"...you're just as f*cked-up"
"as we are."
"Rather more so, I'd say."
"Maybe."
"Hey, how come everybody here"
"just stays so distant from us?"
"Is that like a..."
"a health thing or something?"
"What I mean is,"
"they never really wander close."
"Because it's not real."
"It's an augmentation."
"Do this."
"It's technology developed"
"by the Research Institute."
"Holy sh*t."
"Why?"
"Mood enhancer,"
"I suppose you'd call it."
"Makes the world"
"a bit less bleak."
"Honestly, one forgets"
"it's even happening."
"It's just there,"
"like the weather."
"But everything else"
"is real, though, right?"
"Some of the buildings"
"are filled in."
"The ones they haven't gotten"
"around to re-fabricating as yet."
"Look... here."
"Oh, my God."
"If the R.I. is doing sh*t like"
"this right out in the open,"
"what are they doing in secret?"
"Cherise said that I copied data"
"from her that night."
"That I stole it."
"She's gonna keep trying to"
"kill me till she gets it back,"
"whatever the hell it is."
"She made that"
"pretty f*cking clear."
"The fabricator we're going"
"to see might be able to help."
"He built Aelita's Peripherals"
"for her."
"So it's possible"
"he'll know where she is."
"How are you so sure it's him?"
"Based on these."
"I have one of these?"
"Mm-hmm."
"That night,"
"when Aelita pressed my eye"
"up against that thing,"
"I felt something."
"Is there any way that Aelita"
"could've downloaded data"
"into the stub?"
"Theoretically."
"But she would need to download"
"it into something in your world."
"What kind of thing?"
"Honestly,"
"only Aelita could tell us."
"Hello."
"What'll it be, then?"
"Uh, toad-in-the-hole, please."
"We don't carry that."
"There's a special"
"on pork today."
"That'd be my pick."
"That's a shame."
"I'm afraid we had our hearts"
"set on toad-in-the-hole."
"We've been assured"
"it's your specialty."
"You two look like"
"a lovely young couple."
"You might want"
"to be on your way"
"before anyone gets hurt."
"Mm."
"Now..."
"...what do you think"
"of me, mister?"
"I don't know you from Eve, love."
"Well, you see,"
"the guy who built this,"
"he assured me that"
"it was better than"
"anything you could ever do."
"Even in your prime."
"In my prime?"
"Yeah, before your craftsmanship"
"started to slip."
"And who the f*ck might"
"this person be?"
"I'm not saying"
"that I believe him."
"Just repeating what"
"he said to me."
"Just to brighten up my day"
"a little bit?"
"Well, you see, he promised me"
"my money back..."
"if I could prove him wrong."
"So I figured, hell,"
"why not give you a shot"
"to prove that you still got it?"
"I don't come cheap."
"Money won't be an issue."
"All right."
"It's not terrible,"
"but I'll wager"
"I'll get your money back"
"without much exertion."
"Hmm."
"Yeah, we have a new add-on"
"I'm rather tickled by."
"Titanium fingernails."
"Retractable."
"Scratch your way out"
"of a stone house if you want."
"What about eyes?"
"Any fool can augment eyes."
"What do you want?"
"Night vision? Thermal?"
"What if I want"
"to replace one?"
"With a human eye."
"Get up."
"Oh, for f*ck's sake,"
"Abby, give it a rest"
"before you get us both killed."
"Tell us about this woman."
"You can start talking,"
"Reggie,"
"or I can start cutting."
"Choice is yours."
"What do you think"
"they'll do to me?"
"Who?"
"The Neoprims."
"They don't muck around"
"with something like this."
"Cut my tongue out, they would."
"What do Neoprims have"
"to do with this?"
"Oh, Jesus, lad."
"She had me build it"
"so someone could"
"carve out its eye,"
"put in a human one."
"Who else but a Neoprim"
"would know how to do that?"
"Old-time surgery"
"and a scalpel?"
"Wait, wait."
"You can't go out like that."
"You didn't tell me that Aelita"
"was a Neoprim."
"I didn't know."
"Did you tell her"
"what you did?"
"When they took over your school?"
"Hey."
"Sorry, Wilf."
"f*ck."
"Piece of sh*t."
"Aah!"
"Okay, just go..."
"Oh, hey, man."
"I didn't see you there."
"You, um..."
"you coming or going?"
"Someone called you."
"I-I'm just here to get a, uh,"
"you know."
"A what, Macon?"
"Coffee, I guess."
"Yeah, they,"
"yeah, they called me."
"Mm."
"What I'm wondering is..."
"why they don't just"
"come out themselves!"
"Scared to, I think."
"You ain't scared?"
"I don't know."
"What? Yeah, a little bit."
"Hmm."
"There's a crescent wrench"
"somewhere under that tow truck."
"You, uh, you want me to get it?"
"For you?"
"All right, you got it?"
"Okay, just here?"
"Yeah, right there."
"Just clamp it on."
"Here we go."
"That's it."
"Anything else?"
"Tell me about that tech"
"Flynne's been using."
"Hey, uh, honestly, Conner,"
"don't..."
"don't take this"
"the wrong way, but"
"I'm thinking I should ask"
"Flynne and Burton"
"what I can be... be sharing."
"I used it. The headset."
"Burton knows."
"It's real, right?"
"Flynne's piloting a real body"
"in a real place?"
"That's my understanding."
"What's the limit, you figure?"
"How do you mean?"
"Is there a time limit"
"to how long"
"you can go there?"
"I mean, you gotta..."
"you gotta pee, right?"
"Drink, eat and all that."
"So, uh..."
"I was in a bed"
"at Walter Reed,"
"more or less comatose"
"for eight months."
"Catheter for the peeing,"
"IV for the drinking,"
"tube for... the eating."
"You..."
"Are you saying what"
"I think you're saying?"
"If someone would"
"make me a body,"
"could you and Edward"
"set me up to live in that place?"
"Permanent-like?"
"Look, I'm not a doctor, Conner,"
"but I just don't think"
"your-your real body..."
"your body here..."
"would take too kindly"
"to that, man."
"Look, I'm-I'm sorry, I just..."
"I don't know how long you'd last"
"is what I'm saying."
"You're about as smart"
"as we make 'em around here,"
"ain't you, Macon?"
"Yeah."
"I-I don't know about that."
"Yeah, you are."
"Trust me."
"So if you can't imagine"
"what it's like"
"to wake up,"
"find yourself in a body"
"like this..."
"probably just 'cause"
"you ain't tried."
"So why don't you think"
"on that for a bit?"
"Then we'll have"
"this conversation again."
"Always a bit creepy, innit?"
"When the AI takes hold?"
"The Sistine Chapel moment."
"Which is meant"
"to mean something, I'm sure."
"God reaching toward Adam,"
"transmitting the spark of life."
"I got it."
"Just follow the stupid"
"little ball, right?"
"It's not a game, Tommy."
"Can you track it?"
"Yeah."
"We, uh... we good?"
"There's a jitter"
"in your eye movement."
"Along with the dizziness,"
"the ringing."
"Oh, I'm fine."
"You're concussed."
"Probable whiplash."
"Gonna need a CT scan."
"I took bigger hits going"
"over the middle in high school."
"I got to, uh, get back to it."
"That sounds smart."
"Like someone thinking straight."
"I gave the Fishers my word."
"Told 'em that I'd handle this."
"Given what just happened,"
"I think you need to"
"let that go."
"That was my arrest."
"In my custody."
"I can't just let that go."
"You didn't."
"You almost got killed."
"Maybe that should be"
"the bigger concern here."
"I'm very concerned."
"And that's why I need"
"to get back out there,"
"find the son of a bitch"
"who did this and bring him in."
"We both know"
"who did this, Tommy."
"You're acting like the frog"
"who gave the scorpion a ride"
"across the river."
"Can't figure out"
"why it stung him"
"as they both drown."
"What do you want me to do?"
"Take the medical leave"
"from the department."
"Lay low."
"My two-year obligation here"
"is almost up."
"I can find work anywhere."
"Buy some time to pick up,"
"move on."
"This is my home, Dee."
"I grew up in this town."
"I worked here my whole life."
"And so you know"
"who controls it."
"And he just told you"
"that he's a scorpion."
"I can't have you"
"getting stung again."
"I ain't running from this."
"Recipe says we still got"
"ten more minutes."
"Well, I guess we're all lucky"
"that I don't need"
"a recipe to cook, then."
"Because if I did,"
"this might taste like..."
"Like what?"
"Trying to think"
"of the right word."
"Shoe leather is what"
"they usually say."
"Which is why I'm avoiding it."
"Not wanting to traffic"
"in clichÃ©s."
"Taste."
"Okay."
"Okay what?"
"Okay, you were right."
"I think you're forgetting"
"the last part of that."
"Which is?"
"""As usual."""
"Huh, our guest"
"has revived."
"Well, sir,"
"your timing is perfect."
"Dig in while it's hot."
"Oh, uh, we took some liberties"
"while you were asleep."
"The state in which"
"you were delivered to us"
"was, uh..."
"What's that word you used?"
"Unsavory."
"Ah. Well, fresh clothes,"
"so forth."
"Now, the collar is an accessory"
"you'll have to adapt to."
"What does it do?"
"Well, there are"
"two schools of thought"
"on that sort of thing."
"There are folks that fall"
"into the camp of,"
"""Blessed are they that have not"
"seen, and yet still believe."""
"John 20:29."
"And then there are"
"folks that follow the path of,"

"Which school do you belong to?"
"The rock and roll school,"

"I know, I know, I know."
"Yeah. Okay. Here, here."
"Here. Here. There."
"Here. There."
"Oh, uh, it's adjustable."
"One through ten."
"That was a four."
"Three, actually."
"Ooh. An unpleasant experience"
"either way."
"Was it you hired me?"
"Try the roast."
"Please."
"What do you think?"
"Be honest."
"It's good."
"You know the best way"
"to tenderize meat?"
"Hmm?"
"Well, most folks use a mallet."
"It's, uh, quick, easy."
"But messy, too."
"And the results aren't"
"guaranteed."
"That's why I prefer a brine."
"A slow, controlled process"
"that alters the very nature"
"of what you consume"
"so it suits your taste."
"And when you find"
"that perfect brine,"
"it's almost always guaranteed."
"Now..."
"recently,"
"I have come to discover"
"someone is in my kitchen"
"f*cking up my brine."
"And I want to know who it is."
"Burton said you had"
"another flashback."
"A bad one."
"You taking anything?"
"No, it don't help."
"Still feel 'em."
"Let me drain some off."
"Oh, that's not your problem"
"no more, Leon."
"How about I sing, then?"
"Everybody seems to think"
"my voice has"

"We haven't been introduced."
"Someone my age is all feeds,"

"For my sins, I have continual"

"Not in the least, ma'am."
"No offense taken."
"Which, in a sense,"
"I suppose I do."
"Yes, ma'am, I would say so."
"Would you introduce me"
"to Mr. Zubov"
"and Mr. Netherton, please?"
"It's Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer"
"of the Metropolitan Police."
"The Metropolitan Police, sir."
"Policeman?"
"An Inspector."
"Call my father's solicitors."
"Immediately!"
"The phones have been disabled."
"Uh, perhaps it might be prudent"
"for me to slip out the back."
"She knows you're here."
"She mentioned you by name."
"How should I proceed, sir?"
"Well, let her in,"
"for f*ck's sake."
"It'll look incriminating"

"Something happened."
"Thought you should know."
"Now, that old man"
"that I took into custody"
"from the bridge?"
"Yeah."
"I don't quite know how"
"to say this, Burton,"
"but, um... whole thing"
"just went sideways..."
"And you f*cking lost him?"
"Hey, now, hold on a second."
"All right?"
"It wasn't like that."
"How was it, then, Tommy?"
"'Cause you had"
"one f*cking job"
"and you lost him."
"I got T-boned, Burton."
"And I'm trying to tell you"
"it wasn't an accident."
"It was more like a..."
"an ambush."
"An ambush?"
"Here's the thing"
"about an ambush, Tommy,"
"having been on both ends of 'em"
"many a time."
"You see, an ambush"
"generally requires"
"specific intel about both the"
"target and the intended route."
"Now, that's what"
"I'm telling you, Burton."
"It's like I was targeted."
"Like they already knew"
"something."
"Who? What are you"
"talking about, Tommy?"
"Whoever it was, they knew"
"who I had in custody."
"They knew I was on the way."
"To the Sheriff's Department?"
"That's right."
"Sheriff Jackman."
"Which leads me to believe"
"that Corbell Pickett"
"now has our guy."
"That just about makes sense."
"Well, I sure as hell"
"don't get it."
"Look, Burton,"
"the way all this started,"
"with the-the cloaked cars,"
"the shells."
"And whatever the hell"
"went down here that day."
"The lottery. Now this?"
"Come on, man, what the hell"
"is going on here, Burton?"
"You know what, Tommy,"
"why don't you just"
"do yourself a favor and"
"get the f*ck out of the way?"
"I've known your family"
"my whole damn life,"
"and that's all you got for me?"
"It ain't just Pickett."
"There's other forces in play"
"want us dead, and you just keep getting in the f*cking way."
"Other forces?"
"The f*ck am I supposed"
"to do with that, Burton?"
"I'm just saying"
"that's why you're all beat up,"
"broken down, lucky to be alive."
"Next ambush..."
"you might not be so lucky."
"I'm just"
"a little concerned, Sheriff,"
"that your deputy's becoming"
"a liability we can't afford."
"Well, Corbell,"
"let's just say you want"
"to sit right there"
"and have a look at"
"that little footage"
"of Tommy Constantine and"
"that prisoner that he lost."
"You gonna need"
"two damn passwords"
"just to dip in there"
"and have a look."
"Silly is what it is."
"You want to guess"
"what passwords I chose?"
"Well, that's sort of"
"the whole point in passwords,"
"isn't it, Sheriff?"
"So folks can't guess 'em?"
"""f*ck you"" and ""eat sh*t."""
"All caps."

"How"
"old are you, son?"
"I'm guessing 28 or so?"
"I know you aren't"
"inclined to do much chatting."
"And I guess I understand,"
"given your circumstances."
"I certainly don't take offense,"
"but here's the thing."
"Corbell bet me"
"I couldn't get you talking."
"So he's offering"
"to buy me a particular"
"baby-blue Mustang convertible"
"I've had my eye on"
"over in Asheville."
"Now, this might seem like"
"a technicality,"
"but Corbell didn't specify"
"you talking about what."
"Just talking, plain and simple."
"So I'm thinking"
"maybe you and I could"
"put our heads together"
"and come to"
"some sort of understanding."
"You agree to do"
"a little talking"
"when Corbell gets back,"
"and I offer something"
"in exchange."
"Don't get dirty-minded on me."
"Please. I'm not that kind."
"But there must be"

"Is that saltwater?"
"That was Corbell's inclination."
"Must be a male thing."
"Saltwater seem a little"

"and 24 hours later,"
"the whole lot'll follow suit,"
"and I mean all of them."
"Bobbing around in there,"
"belly up."
"You have to empty the tank,"
"sterilize it,"
"start all over again."
"We went through that"
"three times."
"Then I put my foot down."
"Firmly."
"So that right there"
"would be 200 gallons"
"of fresh water"
"you're looking at."
"And I don't feel"
"any shame to say so."
"May I?"
"You'll see some blue rams"
"in there, cherry barbs,"
"electric blue haps."
"Those are my favorites."
"Real subtle, I think."
"And, of course,"
"the fantail guppies."
"Kind of a freshwater..."
"Hey!"
"The f*ck are you thinking, old man?"
"You're a guest in our home."
"And look what you did to my pedi."
"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no!"
"Do you play chess, Mr. Zubov?"
"Well... it's not nearly"
"as much fun"
"now that we all have"
"our AI crutches to lean on."
"But it was once"
"a rather fascinating diversion."
"There was a sense"
"of mastery one could feel"
"at a certain point,"
"when every move you made seemed"
"to dictate"
"your opponent's response."
"And then, such a thrill"
"when that illusion was"
"interrupted by the shock"
"of an unexpected countermove."
"Can you surprise me,"
"Mr. Zubov?"
"I'm very sorry, Inspector."
"But I wonder"
"if it might make sense"
"for my family's solicitors"
"to join us?"
"Exactly as I feared."
"The expected move."
"It's your decision, of course."
"But should you choose"
"to summon your solicitors,"
"here's how our encounter"
"will unfold."
"Your friend, Mr. Netherton,"
"has been geolocated"
"at the site of a crime."
"A murder, to be precise,"
"of one Daniel Cook,"
"Head of Security"
"of the Research Institute."
"Killed, it would appear,"
"by a Koid."
"Now, I could put Mr. Netherton"
"on trial as an accomplice,"
"which would mean"
"that right here,"
"in your drawing room,"
"seven or so minutes from now,"
"we'd likely witness poor"
"Mr. Netherton's execution."
"But of course,"
"when you're fishing,"
"and you catch a minnow,"
"the wise angler simply"
"impales it on a hook"
"and uses it"
"to catch a bigger fish."
"I don't mean"
"to belittle you, Mr. Netherton,"
"but in my world,"
"you don't qualify"
"as much of a trophy."
"Which could most decidedly"
"work to your advantage here."
"Because, as your trial began,"
"I'd make it quite clear"
"that you might save"
"your own life"
"by diverting my attention"
"to a larger fish."
"Should you happen"
"to know one, that is."
"You two are old friends,"
"of course."
"And that must exert"
"its pull upon the soul."
"But it's always intriguing to me"
"how the power of sentiment"
"begins to slip away"
"when a sharp blade is"
"at one's throat."
"The salmon, thank you."
"And just a splash of milk"
"in the tea, please."
"You've done rather well"
"for yourself, Mr. Murphy,"
"considering the frequency"
"of your youthful encounters"
"with the law."
"It's heartening to behold."
"In my experience, Mr. Zubov,"
"at this point in the game,"
"it can grow a tad fraught"
"on your side of the board."
"Your family's affairs are rather"
"elaborately woven together,"
"I assume,"
"and I can't help but wonder"
"what sort"
"of unraveling might occur"
"if I managed to get hold"
"of a tiny thread, and..."
"I'm making a hash of"
"my metaphors again, aren't I?"
"Chess, fishing, tangled threads."
"You're supposed to help me"
"with that, Beatrice."
"You seemed to be"
"enjoying yourself, ma'am."
"It felt rude to interrupt."
"Regardless."
"That's how I see our"
"little drama playing out here,"
"should you summon"
"your solicitors."
"How does that sound to you?"
"I quite agree. Tiresome."
"Unbearably so."
"And we'd likely lose"
"Mr. Netherton to boot."
"How much more appealing"
"to set all of this aside"
"for the moment,"
"and simply answer"
"a few questions,"
"honestly, directly, thoroughly?"
"And who knows?"
"Could very well propel us into"
"a far more intriguing adventure."
"What do you think? Hmm?"
"Shall we attempt it?"
"All right, then."
"The Met has detected"
"three Peripherals on site,"
"running on AI."
"Would you summon them, please?"
"I'd so enjoy a quick peek."
"And..."
"their operators, too?"
"I'm afraid that might prove"
"to be rather complicated,"
"Inspector."
"Well, I think"
"you'll soon discover"
"I'm rather good"
"at rather complicated."
"And when would you like..."
"Now, Mr. Zubov."
"Or soonest."
"Although as close"
"to now as possible"
"would be my decided preference."
"Bless us,"
"O Heavenly Father,"
"and these thy gifts,"
"which we are about"
"to receive from Thy bounty,"
"through Jesus Christ"
"our Lord. Amen."
"It ain't my birthday,"
"if that's what you're thinking."
"Nope. That flashback"
"you woke up to,"
"it's been weighing on me a bit."
"Seemed pretty f*cking intense."
"So I thought I'd stop by,"
"see how you're holding up."
"And?"
"You tell me."
"Fit as a fiddle, son."
"Even got some French toast,"
"hot off the stove."
"Might be inclined"
"to spare you a slice,"
"if you promise"
"to show some table manners."
"Well, you know that'd be"
"a steep climb for me, Conner."
"And I already ate,"
"but thank you. You go at it."
"You know, if you were"
"to fetch it for me,"
"I suppose I could"
"just sit out here and"
"eat in this beautiful"
"f*cking weather."
"f*cking A."
"Conner Penske just"
"asked me for help!"
"And there ain't a single f*cking"
"witness around to prove it."
"You gonna be an asshole"
"and let my breakfast get cold?"
"Chop-chop, buddy!"
"Will there be anything else,"
"Your Majesty?"
"Yeah."
"What's in the box?"
"Present from our friends"
"in the future."
"Macon and Edward printed it up."
"Check it out."
"That's not as badass"
"as what Flynne fabs."
"Flynne's printed you legs?"
"Got a whole collection"
"of 'em inside."
"She works at 'em, too."
"They're like... artwork."
"Got a good heart, that Flynne."
"How come you never wear 'em?"
"Sometimes I feel like"
"all this stuff is more"
"for y'all folks than me."
"Makes people feel better"
"when they see me coming"
"without actually"
"being of much use."
"Yeah, I hear that,"
"but these are supposed"
"to be hella more functional than"
"anything we can do on our own."
"Still fake, ain't they?"
"I hate to break it to you,"
"Conner, but I don't think"
"you're gonna grow real ones"
"anytime soon."
"I got real ones."
"Waiting for me"
"off in the future."
"Yeah, I've been hearing"
"something about that."
"Going for the old IV"
"and catheter, huh?"
"Got to be a little less subtle"
"with your disapproval, Burton,"
"if you want me to react."
"sh*t, man. When's the last time"
"you seen me this happy?"
"Mm."
"You know, I've been"
"wondering something."
"Those first days in the hospital"
"after you got blown up,"
"you remember me coming"
"to visit you?"
"Little bit."
"That thing you asked me to do?"
"That f*cked me up"
"pretty good, Conner."
"That I asked?"
"That I couldn't do it."
"Well, what you did instead"
"messed me up"
"so I guess we're even."
"What'd I do instead?"
"Wrote that sh*t on the wall"
"across from my bed."
"Oh. Yeah."
"I figured if anything was"
"gonna get you up again,"
"it'd be a little"
"Burton-Was-Here action."
"I kept picturing you"
"lying there,"
"desperate"
"to go scrawl ""MF"" on it."
"They shipped me off"
"before I could."
"This thing"
"you're thinking of trying"
"with the catheter and the IV?"
"One way of looking at it is,"
"it's a lot like putting"
"a pillow over your face,"
"or eating a bullet."
"Just a slowed-down version."
"sh*t, Burton."
"One way of looking"
"at life, period,"
"is it's a slowed-down version"
"of eating a bullet."
"You're a trip, Conner."
"I'm just saying, I got to think"
"on it before I help you"
"with this little relocation plan"
"of yours, all right?"
"Fair enough."
"And in the meantime, how about"
"you give these fancy fellas"
"a try?"
"Ah, f*ck it."
"Maybe tomorrow."
"Hey, you want"
"to know something funny?"
"We've still got these,"
"carved and scrawled,"
"all over the house,"
"from when we were little."
"And if you ask my mama"
"what ""MF"" means,"
"she'll tell you"
"it means ""my friend."""
"Don't it?"
"Yeah."
"I guess it does,"
"Motherf*cker."
"I hope you didn't eat too much."
"Why?"
"London's calling."
"They're wanting us back."
"Any idea what"
"we're heading into?"
"Nope."
"All they said was to send"
"you three together. ""Soonest,"""
"whatever the f*ck that means."
"No plan, no intel,"
"no recon."
"And you know"
"what that calls for, don't you?"
"""Speed, intensity, and...""?"
"""Violence of action."""
"Boom!"
"Oorah, motherf*cker."
"So this quantum"
"tunnel, as you term it,"
"allows you to communicate"
"with the past."
"Or rather a past, since"
"in our actual past, you didn't."
"That actually hurts"
"my head, Mr. Zubov."
"I gather it doesn't hurt yours?"
"It's actually quite simple."
"The act of connection produces"
"a fork in causality,"
"the new branch causally unique."
"A stub, as we call them."
"But why do you?"
"Call them that?"
"It sounds short,"
"nasty, brutish."
"Wouldn't one expect"
"the fork's new branch"
"to continue to grow?"
"We do assume exactly that."
"I'm not sure where the term might've..."
"Imperialism."
"Calling it a stub"
"makes it a bit easier"
"for us to third-world it."
"And you facilitate"
"Mr. Zubov in this colonialism?"
"You and Mr. Murphy?"
"They're crowning."
"And you, I presume, are"
"the formidable Flynne Fisher?"
"Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer"
"of the Metropolitan Police."
"Quite pleased"
"to make your acquaintance."
"Ma'am."
"What is this?"
"It's where"
"the animals come to play."
"Something"
"of great value"
"has been stolen from me."
"We can talk"
"this thing through,"
"come to an understanding here."
"We got to go."
"I just need you to trust me to do it right."
"Execute."
"Lights out."
"I look at you and all this..."
"It's just so different"
"from where I live."
"Thomas, we'll need"
"you to take some time off."
"That man is loose"
"on my watch, sir."
"All that's gonna get sorted;"
"I'm gonna see to it myself."
"Maybe you and I could come to"
"some sort of understanding."
"And I offer something"
"in exchange."
"No plan. No intel. No recon."
"Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer,"
"Metropolitan Police."
"Is anyone out here?"
"Something wrong, Ms. Fisher?"
"Reece, honey."
"I think I might need you"
"to take me to the doctor."
"You want me to call Burton..."
"No, no, no."
"I don't want to worry them."
"I'm sure it's fine."
"Let's just go, you and me."
"Uh..."
"It's okay, hon."
"Promise. I'll talk to 'em"
"once... once we get back."
"Uh, my truck's on the drive."
"I'm afraid I'll need"
"your help, Reece."
"I, uh..."
"I can't seem to..."
"I'm blind again."
"Dear me."
"It seems your life has taken"
"some decidedly unexpected turns"
"in the past week"
"or so, young lady."
"Yes, ma'am."
"And now what?"
"Do you have a plan?"
"Or do you just intend"
"to keep parrying"
"blows as they land,"
"hoping for the best?"
"Um..."
"Well, I know what I'd"
"like to do, Beatrice."
"I'd like to stretch"
"my legs a bit."
"Get some fresh air."
"Yes, ma'am."
"Now, please"
"don't take this wrong,"
"Mr. Zubov, but"
"you've chosen an"
"extremely oppressive"
"decorative scheme here."
"Well, then, Inspector."
"Would you prefer the garden?"
"I'd prefer to leave altogether."
"And take these three"
"young visitors with"
"me, so we can finish"
"our little chat"
"alfresco, as they say."
"Shall we?"
"Um,"
"not to be disrespectful,"
"but I'd feel a whole"
"lot more comfortable"
"if Wilf could join us."
"How sweet."
"You've already"
"made a friend here."
"Now be a sport,"
"then, Mr. Netherton."
"Do join us."
"I'm sorry"
"to burst in on you"
"like this without an"
"appointment, Dee Dee."
"It's always a pleasure"
"to see you, Ella,"
"appointment or not. Reece,"
"would you mind helping her up?"
"Yeah, sure. This way."
"There you go."
"Thank you."
"So, what's troubling you?"
"Mind if I wait"
"outside, Mrs. Fisher?"
"Oh, of course not, hon."
"Right."
"Oh, Reece, would you tell"
"Liz to go ahead and"
"take her lunch break?"
"Yeah, sure."
"So..."
"how are you feeling?"
"Aren't you supposed to be on"
"some sort of sick leave, Tommy?"
"Yeah. But I realized"
"I never followed up on"
"the evidence I collected"
"from that incident"
"on the bridge."
"Just, uh, wanted to make sure"
"it was all cataloged properly."
"And what evidence would that be?"
"Weaponry the old"
"man was carrying."
"Which was what, exactly?"
"Well, he had a-a"
"Glock, if I recall."
"And this, uh, other doodad."
"Looked a little"
"like a flashlight."
"Oh, a ""doodad,"" huh?"
"That bear any resemblance"
"to a thingamabob?"
"Was anything taken"
"into evidence?"
"After that SUV hit me?"
"The one you claim"
"was invisible, you mean?"
"What are you doing?"
"Calling Dee Dee."
"So she can take you..."
"You've been knocked"
"sideways, Tommy."
"Hard."
"You need to lie"
"down in a dark room"
"with ice on your head and"
"a cold beer in your hand."
"You answer my question, Gladys,"
"and I will get right on that."
"Promise."
"Nothing was put into evidence"
"except your totaled cruiser."
"No Glocks."
"No ""doodads."""
"No old man, for that matter."
"Just you and your"
"wrecked car, Tommy."
"Now go home."
"Before I call Sheriff Jackman..."
"so he can tell you"
"the same damn thing,"
"in a less loving manner."
"What is this?"
"A Met Police"
"training facility."
"We call it The Zoo."
"Why?"
"It's where the"
"animals come to play."
"Completely secure"
"from any potential"
"R.I. surveillance"
"or interference."
"Or Klept, for that matter."
"You two and Beatrice are"
"going to have some fun."
"You're going to climb to the..."
"How many floors do you think"
"they can manage, Beatrice?"
"Let's try eight."
"Feeling ambitious, are we?"
"All right, then."
"Eighth floor."
"Unlike Miss Fisher,"
"you're new to these bodies."
"This exercise should"
"get you up to speed."
"What?"
"This is where"
"our Met Koids are tested."
"Think of it as something like"
"what your sister believed"
"she was playing when"
"she first came here."
"A sim, I think you call it?"
"Follow Beatrice. She'll"
"explain everything."
"Well, can I go, too?"
"Not this time, dear."
"I have a different test for you."
"Shall we sit?"
"It's fairly"
"straightforward, gentlemen."
"We advance from floor to floor,"
"killing or disabling"
"everything we encounter."
"Until we reach the roof."
"What happens there?"
"A surprise."
"What kind?"
"A surprise"
"is generally defined"
"as ""an unexpected event."""
"Do you need me to"
"define ""unexpected""?"
"Don't take this the"
"wrong way, ma'am."
"But are you, like... human?"
"Why do you ask?"
"Well, you don't"
"seem too concerned"
"about potential"
"bodily harm here."
"That's very kind of you to"
"inquire, Lance Corporal."
"Let's just say I'm special."
"By which I mean you should"
"worry about yourselves"
"in the coming adventure."
"Let me worry about me."
"We get weapons?"
"Only what you can"
"claim on the way."
"Shall we?"
"You got"
"night vision, dude."
"How?"
"Tongue to palate."
"Just like our haptics."
"Well, that wasn't so bad."
"Are you good with numbers?"
"Top of the class, baby."
"How many assailants"
"did we encounter here?"
"Six?"
"There will be 12"
"on the next floor."
"Eighteen on the one"
"after that. And so on."
"Forty-eight up top?"
"Only if you make it that far."
"What are these?"
"Your basic Koid Series 24-A."
"Modified, of course,"
"for the task at hand."
"What's a Koid?"
"A robot. Bipedal."
"Eyes are human."
"Only for verisimilitude's sake."
"Speed, intensity, and"
"violence of action."
"Your unit's motto,"
"if I'm not mistaken."
"And?"
"A little more speed might"
"be nice here, gentlemen."
"Most of our trainees are already"
"clearing the third floor by now."
"Yeah, Gladys."
"A f*cking doodad."
"Sheriff?"
"Tommy, where are you?"
"I, uh..."
"Whatever you're doing,"
"I need you to drop it."
"Need you to come over"
"here to Corbell Pickett's."
"Thought I was on leave, sir."
"You were."
"I just canceled it. Stop talking"
"and get your ass in gear."
"We got a situation on"
"our hands over here."
"I need you to help me fix it."
"Copy that."
"Oh, Lord. I'm"
"hurt. I'm hurt bad."
"Hello?"
"Help me."
"I'm hurt real bad."
"Are you okay?"
"Call Tommy."
"Dee Dee? What's happening?"
"I'm unavailable to take your call."
"Dammit, Tommy."
"Pick up."
"Leave a message."
"I'll return it at my"
"earliest convenience."
"That's it. That's"
"it. Yeah. That's it."
"That's it."
"That's it. There you go."
"There you go."
"f*ck's sake."
"Motherf*cker."
"Reece?"
"Anyone else here?"
"What's happening?"
"What's going on?"
"Tell me, Dee Dee,"
"what is going on?"
"Hey. I need"
"you to calm her down."
"Or you're both gonna get shot."
"It's all right."
"I'm right here."
"Where's Reece? Why isn't he answering..."
"Shh."
"He just..."
"stepped outside."
"Sit. Both of you."
"On your hands."
"It's him, isn't it?"
"Who?"
"The man from the bridge."
"I don't mean"
"to be rude, ma'am."
"But you need to shut your mouth."
"And keep it shut."
"Did you notice?"
"She sampled our f*cking DNA."
"How else could she be sure"
"we're who we claim to be?"
"We could bloody sample hers."
"And be renditioned."
"I've never met a senior"
"police officer before."
"A rather extraordinary"
"individual."
"They're all like"
"that, unfortunately."
"There are..."
"Himself?"
"Yes, sir?"
"I need you to access the"
"Peripheral's point of view."
"I want to know what"
"they're discussing."
"I'm afraid I can't"
"do that, Mr. Zubov."
"Or won't, rather."
"Excuse me?"
"The inspector would"
"know if we were to attempt it."
"Just as she very likely knows"
"that we're having this rather"
"misguided conversation."
"He just ask what I think he did?"
"If"
"we were smart, we'd be packing."
"We'd be gone."
"We leave, this was"
"all for nothing."
"We'd lose access to the stub"
"and what's inside the girl."
"I'm not sure it's"
"worth dying for, luv."
"And I'm not sure I can live"
"with having run away from it."
"How about you?"
"Are you steady, Ossian?"
"Yes. I'm f*cking steady."
"Well, Miss Fisher, the Aunties"
"have managed to track down"
"some rather interesting"
"information."
"The Aunties?"
"The Met's"
"data-sorting algorithms."
"Busy little bees, buzzing about."
"I imagine you'll be"
"happy to learn that"
"your friend, Mr. Penske,"
"didn't lose his limbs"
"in my own timeline."
"But that would mean"
"that-that... Texas..."
"That the R.I."
"must've opened the stub"
"at least a decade earlier"
"than you've all been assuming."
"As such, significant divergences"
"have already been occurring"
"in our two time lines,"
"the most disturbing of"
"which is the Jackpot."
"It appears to be happening at an"
"accelerated rate in your world."
"My assumption is"
"the R.I. is driving"
"this process intentionally."
"To what end?"
"That's a question only"
"Cherise Nuland can answer."
"The Texas War?"
"The secession, did"
"it happen for you?"
"Indeed."
"Both Mr. Penske and your"
"brother went off to fight in it."
"But the haptic technology"
"implanted in their bodies"
"was decades away from being"
"developed in my own time line,"
"so they fought as"
"common soldiers."
"A-And Conner didn't get hurt?"
"He survived"
"the war unscathed."
"But your brother did not."
"What, he got wounded?"
"Killed."
"I thought you said"
"details like this"
"were impossible to retrieve."
"And he was"
"correct, for the most part."
"But the Aunties are"
"privy to archives"
"unavailable to the"
"general public."
"Well, what about me?"
"The data becomes a bit spotty"
"once the Jackpot takes off."
"But it appears you married."
"Had two children."
"Married who?"
"Sheriff Thomas Constantine."
"I married Tommy?"
"Indeed. Makes one wonder about"
"etiquette here, doesn't it?"
"Whether congratulations"
"are in order?"
"Now, of course, the"
"Aunties have told me about"
"a Flynne Fisher who"
"no longer exists."
"But about you, my dear..."
"I know next to nothing."
"It's rather refreshing."
"I don't suppose you've"
"had many job interviews?"
"Just Forever Fab."
"But it wasn't really"
"a job interview."
"Just a drug test."
"But did you pass?"
"Of course."
"Excellent."
"What I mean to say is..."
"let's approach this encounter"
"as something along those lines."
"A getting-to-know-each-other"
"moment."
"I'm going to ask"
"a few questions."
"Try and answer them as quickly"
"as you can, without thinking."
"Can you do that?"
"A lot of people have"
"a tough time with"
"it... knife work."
"You might laugh,"
"but they have these"
"how-to videos online, you know."
"Slashing versus thrusting,"
"arteries versus organs,"
"that sort of thing."
"In my experience, though,"
"it's all about speed."
"The most amount of holes in"
"the least amount of time."
"Simple as."
"When you think about it,"
"well, that's pretty much"
"the opposite of how you've"
"been trained, isn't it?"
"Which, I imagine, could make"
"it quite difficult to overcome."
"Not to mention"
"the other hurdles,"
"the ""thou shalt not"" of it all."
"Now, I'd say you'd get"
"one good swipe, tops,"
"before I'd open you up like a..."
"What do you call those..."
"What's the difference between"
"a sieve and a colander?"
"Are they the same, or what?"
"This is f*cking amazing."
"I told you, bruh. I'm"
"moving here. Full-time."
"What's the surprise?"
"The training module"
"isn't considered complete"
"until only one of"
"us remains standing."
"Surprise."
"Greatest fear?"
"My mama dying."
"Greatest strength?"
"That I don't"
"know when to give up."
"Weakness?"
"Same thing."
"If you could turn back time,"
"and have none of this"
"ever happen, would you?"
"No."
"If I had the power"
"to sever the connection"
"between our two worlds,"
"would you have me do it?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"You thought too"
"long on that one."
"Froze up."
"It happens."
"Can I ask you some questions?"
"Like the ones you just asked me?"
"Let's say three, as"
"though I were a genie."
"What's your biggest fear?"
"The past."
"What, like where I'm from?"
"Precisely."
"Two down."
"One remaining."
"Do you actually have that power?"
"To cut our connection?"
"I'm sorry, dear, I seem"
"to have overpromised."
"It seems your brother and his"
"friend are almost finished."
"So, I'll say goodbye"
"and Godspeed."
"Our next visit, you'll be"
"more active, I assure you."
"Shorty..."
"you are f*cking amazing."
"Ooh."
"f*cking Christ..."
"You always feel like"
"this when you come out?"
"Boy, I'm gonna marry her."
"Who?"
"That robot lady."
"I can't even read this."
"What?"
"Reece took Mama to Urgent Med."
"He said to come"
"right now. Come on."
"Oh, f*ck. Gimme a sec."
"Man the f*ck up,"
"Burton. We gotta go."
"Hello?"
"Sheriff?"
"What, exactly, do"
"you think you understand?"
"That you're upset."
"I mean, how could you not..."
"I don't think ""upset"""
"quite captures the"
"feeling, Davis."
"I guess not."
"What I mean is,"
"I want to kill someone."
"I want to do it with"
"my bare f*cking..."
"What the"
"f*ck is he doing here?"
"Holster your weapon, son."
"A little late to the party"
"for it to do any kind of good."
"What happened?"
"Well, that prisoner"
"that you lost?"
"He turned up here and"
"killed Mary Pickett."
"Stole one of their vehicles."
"Mr. Pickett, he, uh..."
"he's pretty bent out of shape"
"about it, as you can imagine."
"Right now, I need you to head"
"up to the Fisher residence."
"I want you to take"
"Burton into custody."
"Might as well grab the kid"
"sister, too, while you're at it."
"What do the Fishers got"
"to do with any of this?"
"Well, I'm still crossing my T's"
"and dotting my I's on"
"that, Tommy. But, uh..."
"how's this sound"
"as a first draft?"
"Burton and his war buddies,"
"they've been dipping"
"their collective toe"
"into the drug trade."
"Seems that they crossed"
"somebody they shouldn't have."
"And that somebody"
"hired a hit man"
"to come take them"
"out of this world."
"Now, you had this"
"hit man character"
"in your custody, Tommy."
"But you lost him."
"And he made his way over here"
"to the Pickett residence,"
"intent on stealing a car and"
"making good on his escape."
"Killed poor Mary Pickett rather"
"violently in the process."
"How's that sound, buccaneer?"
"Like you just"
"f*cking made it up."
"Well, that's what you do when"
"you're telling a story, Tommy."
"You make sh*t up."
"Sort of like what"
"you've been doing"
"for the last ten or so years."
"Pretending you don't know the"
"way things run around here."
"Telling yourself whatever little"
"fairytale you needed to hear"
"so you can feel"
"like some sort of"
"blameless Knight of the"
"f*cking Round Table,"
"when all the while,"
"you working for me."
"Which means you working"
"for Corbell Pickett."
"Trust me, son."
"Gonna be a whole lot easier"
"being honest with yourself."
"Takes a frightful"
"amount of energy,"
"working to stay stone blind"
"every f*cking waking hour."
"Now, goddammit,"
"you go get Burton."
"Corbell's got some questions"
"he wants to ask him."
"No."
"Boy, that old man said your life"
"had reached a fork in the road."
"I think he was dead"
"right about that."
"Christ almighty, Tommy."
"You need me to lay"
"this out for you?"
"Sure. Sure, you can do"
"the ""right"" thing here."
"Take Corbell and I down to"
"the station in handcuffs"
"like two dirt dogs."
"And then the three of us,"
"we're going to present"
"our stories to the world."
"Corbell and I, we're"
"gonna tell a story"
"about how you tried to blame"
"others for your failures,"
"which is what the young"
"and the feckless often do."
"You want a stick?"
"You panicked, Tommy."
"You made some"
"un-f*cking-believable story up"
"about how I, Clanton's"
"four-term elected sheriff,"
"crashed a invisible"
"SUV into your cruiser,"
"made off with your prisoner,"
"took him over here,"
"turned him loose"
"at Corbell Pickett's house."
"This being the same"
"Corbell Pickett"
"who employs some 50 to 60%"
"of the people here"
"in Clanton, mind you."
"And then... and then,"
"well, f*ck me, Tommy."
"Even now I'm getting confused."
"You see where I'm going"
"with this, I assume."
"Corbell and I, we get set free"
"with the sincerest of apologies."
"You? At best, you simply lose"
"your job at the department."
"Although there may be some"
"charges pending on you, too..."
"false arrest and"
"that sort of thing."
"Or..."
"there's the other road."
"The go-along-to-get-along road."
"Where you can keep"
"doing the fine work"
"you've always done as a lawman."
"Maybe even pick up some other"
"responsibilities, too..."
"with the appropriate"
"remunerations, of course."
"Or you could just try being"
"adult for a f*cking change."
"You don't have a choice,"
"Tommy. You see that, right?"
"Because my story"
"might not be true..."
"it sure as hell sounds true."
"It's gonna beat your"
"story every goddamn time."
"So why don't we stop dicking"
"around with one another,"
"and you go fetch"
"me Burton Fisher."
"Along with that little sister."
"As you can"
"see, they discovered"
"and utilized their augmentations"
"with admirable dispatch,"
"networking to share"
"visual and aural input."
"Which would imply an overlap"
"with their own rudimentary"
"haptic implants."
"What did you make of them?"
"Their characters, I mean?"
"Brave."
"Assertive. Resolute."
"The brother is likely the more"
"predictable and dependable."
"But I'd be marginally"
"more inclined"
"to turn to his"
"friend in a crisis."
"Why?"
"Ma'am?"
"Well, if the brother is more"
"predictable and dependable,"
"why would you turn"
"to the friend?"
"I'm afraid I lack specific"
"data on that, Inspector."
"The decision was made in"
"my deep neural network,"
"below any level"
"of consciousness."
"Interesting."
"And the young woman?"
"Still"
"an open question."
"Which I hope to answer shortly."
"What is it?"
"Cherise Nuland is downstairs,"
"requesting an audience."
"You were expecting her?"
"I lifted the veil,"
"ever so slightly,"
"on our visit to the"
"Zubov residence,"
"allowing us to be"
"surveilled as we arrived."
"But I certainly"
"didn't anticipate"
"Dr. Nuland to react"
"with such alacrity."
"Have her sent up, please."
"This should be"
"quite informative."
"You f*cking loser."
"How the f*ck you"
"gonna live with this?"
"Huh? I mean..."
"How the f*ck you"
"gonna live with this?"
"Now what?"
"We wait."
"For?"
"I need to kill two people."
"And it would appear that one"
"of them is on the way here."
"You're talking about my"
"children, aren't you?"
"Yes, ma'am, I'm afraid I am."
"Mama's not answering."
"Reece, neither."
"Reece. ""Your mother"
"is asking you"
"to come as quickly"
"as possible."""
"""Your mother""?"
"Yeah, that's f*cking weird."
"Can you link up with him?"
"Oh, sh*t."
"What?"
"I can't get a"
"read on his vitals."
"I'm almost tempted to call"
"the police, Inspector."
"The Uncanny Valley"
"Statute is rather clear"
"that Peripherals"
"should never operate"
"as autonomous beings."
"Beatrice exists under a"
"special waiver to the UVS."
"Hmm. Of course."
"Doesn't look like"
"the R.I.'s handiwork."
"Nice to meet you, Beatrice."
"Pleasure is mine, ma'am."
"Know what's startling?"
"We've found that a lingering"
"effect of the Jackpot"
"is that now the vast"
"majority of Koids"
"have been modified to resemble"
"a missing personal connection."
"Siblings."
"Colleagues."
"Not, as a rule, parents."
"Which is intriguing, is it?"
"It's as if there's"
"something natural"
"about losing a mother or father"
"that makes it easier"
"for us to accept."
"But a child?"
"A daughter..."
"for instance?"
"I'm so sorry, Beatrice."
"I'm going to have to ask"
"you to power down now."
"And please scrub"
"the past five minutes"
"from your memory."
"Powering down now."
"Commencing scrub."
"Pleased with yourself?"
"I'm curious. Why"
"keep it a secret?"
"It would complicate"
"our relationship."
"Yes, I rather suppose it would."
"Why are you here, Doctor?"
"Something of great value"
"has been stolen from me."
"And I seek redress from the law."
"I know you're uneasy with this."
"Uneasy?"
"f*cking terrified is what I am."
"It's not"
"just the Klepts we're crossing here."
"There's the Met Police now"
"too and either one of them"
"would end us..."
"Want me to do it?"
"You realize what"
"this could mean?"
"We're the only ones who know."
"Aelita knows."
"Aelita's dead..."
"Or gone to ground so thoroughly"
"she might as well be."
"This is ours. For the taking."
"How do we access the bacteria?"
"How do we sequence it?"
"All we'll need to do is hire"
"someone in the stub to..."
"Himself, luv."
"Tell me that won't be"
"part of the pleasure."
"Stealing it right out from"
"under his arrogant f*cking..."
"Arrogance is"
"a form of stupidity."
"Wouldn't you agree?"
"It could seem a bit"
"arrogant, for instance,"
"to assume that one's"
"encryption is unbreakable."
"Given that, historically,"
"the supposed impregnability"
"of any particular code"
"has always proven"
"disappointingly short-lived."
"Run to Daddy's study."
"Fetch him a knife."
"Which one?"
"Any will do."
"I'm in a bit of a quandary here."
"Part of me, naturally enough,"
"wants to destroy both of you."
"My inner child, I suppose"
"you could call it."
"Raging. Petulant. Vengeful."
"But the part of me"
"with a cooler head"
"realizes how much I need you."
"Your skill set, certainly."
"And now, it would appear,"
"your secrets, too."
"Also, I like you."
"Well, you, Ash."
"Ossian I could take or leave,"
"depending on my"
"mood. But you..."
"You have a Klept's heart,"
"whether you realize it or not."
"Proud."
"Scheming."
"Aggressive."
"And yes: arrogant."
"So it's all a bit"
"up in the air..."
"I fear."
"What I should do..."
"My favorite."
"Ah!"
"And it's a beauty, my boy."
"May I watch, Daddy?"
"I think not."
"Run along to the kitchen."
"Nanny's made pudding."
"We're... very sorry, sir."
"Shut up, Ossian."
"Tell me what you're up to."
"Or I'll kill him."
"You have ten seconds."
"Aelita thought she was working"
"with the polt's brother."
"She planned to download"
"the stolen R.I. files"
"into his haptic implants."
"Storing them in the"
"stub, in other words,"
"where they'd be untraceable."
"Rather brilliant, I"
"think you'll agree."
"Except for the fact it was the"
"sister piloting the Peripheral."
"And the girl doesn't"
"have implants."
"So her headset translated"
"the data into bacterial DNA."
"Began to colonize her brain."
"What were you hoping"
"to do with that data?"
"Sell it to the highest bidder."
"I don't believe you."
"Give it to the Neoprims."
"Why in the f*cking hell"
"would you want to do that?"
"So they can burn"
"this world down."
"And build a new"
"one in its place."
"You're a fool."
"A romantic fool."
"If you try to"
"double-cross me again..."
"I will have no choice"
"but to carve you up"
"and feed you to my"
"little beauties."
"But I do admire the"
"rest of your plan."
"Let's proceed, shall we?"
"Every single vector"
"of the Jackpot"
"was weaponized by"
"the same disruptor."
"Human nature."
"Now, it might've manifested"
"itself as selfishness"
"or venality or simple stupidity,"
"but at the bottom, it all"
"amounted to the same trait:"
"our persistent,"
"self-destructive resistance"
"to acting for a collective good."
"May I?"
"Please."
"The R.I. was subject to"
"a critical data breach"
"a few nights ago, at the"
"hand of an R.I. employee"
"and a Peripheral piloted"
"from within a stub."
"The presence of"
"a Zubov associate"
"at a subsequent crime scene"
"connected to the breach"
"points definitively"
"to Klept involvement."
"We have reason to believe"
"they were targeting"
"our neural adjustment mechanism,"
"which, as you know, is a highly"
"sensitive area of research."
"So you're telling me"
"that the data that's"
"been stolen from you,"
"it would document the"
"existence of this mechanism?"
"It would."
"And that's what you fear?"
"Backlash and repudiation,"
"should knowledge of"
"this become public?"
"Of course."
"But even more so,"
"a potential hack"
"of the mechanism..."
"to employ it in a"
"less benign manner."
"A possibility already"
"inherent in this technology?"
"Well..."
"I think you'll agree, Inspector,"
"that a hammer is a"
"very useful tool."
"It can also be a deadly weapon,"
"in the wrong hands."
"I believe you met with"
"Lev Zubov recently?"
"I imagine he had quite"
"an interesting tale"
"of his recent adventures"
"in the R.I.'s stub."
"""The R.I.'s""? You"
"claim ownership?"
"Well, I created it, didn't I?"
"For use as a laboratory to"
"develop this technology."
"I don't imagine I need to tell"
"you how dangerous it might be"
"for the Klepts to"
"gain control of it."
"What are you asking of me?"
"Destroy the Zubovs,"
"Flynne Fisher,"
"and everyone"
"associated with them."
"Both here, and in the stub."
"You make"
"it sound so simple."
"As if I could"
"merely wave a wand."
"There's precedent,"
"you'll concede."
"The Samsonovs."
"Their entire clan..."
"erased from the"
"face of the Earth."
"It was quite an"
"awe-inspiring spectacle."
"An entirely different situation."
"Mm... Was it?"
"Sedition? I should think so."
"""Inciting violence against"
"a lawful authority,"
"with the intent"
"to overthrow it""?"
"â™ª If I had a hammer â™ªâ™ª"
"You'll need to absorb and"
"process this all, obviously."
"I"
"only share this with you"
"because I'm confident"
"you have the sophistication"
"and perspicacity"
"to grasp all that's"
"at stake here."
"Come to my lair next time. Hmm?"
"Tea, if you'd like."
"It's for money?"
"What you're doing?"
"There's money involved."
"But that's not why I'm here."
"Why, then?"
"I have a"
"daughter of my own."
"I'd like to keep her"
"alive, if I could."
"Someone's threatening"
"to harm her"
"if you don't kill my children?"
"In a nutshell."
"My mother always said,"
"""Only a fool sees the"
"world as either-or."""
"Which is an admirably"
"simple thought"
"for simple folks living"
"in a simple place."
"But unfortunately,"
"none of that's at play"
"here at the moment."
"You imagine there"
"are only two options."
"Either your daughter has to"
"die, or my children will,"
"and that's the end of it."
"You're saying there's"
"another option?"
"I am."
"But I can just listen to you,"
"to the sound of your voice,"
"and tell you're not"
"the man to consider it."
"Try me."
"You could die."
"What the f*ck are you doing?"
"f*ck."
"Why are we stopped?"
"Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast."
"We need to get a read"
"on the situation."
"If we don't move now, Mama's"
"gonna be next. You know that."
"There's a killer in"
"there, just set a trap."
"We rush in, we all die."
"Burton..."
"This is the one f*cking"
"thing I'm good at, Flynne."
"So right now, I just need you"
"to trust me to do it right."
"f*ck."
"Take these, go that"
"way around the car."
"Let me get this straight."
"So, my not wanting to die"
"here, that makes me a fool?"
"Not just a fool."
"Cowardly, too."
"And selfish."
"Selfish to the point of evil."
"I'm starting to"
"get the impression"
"that you don't like me"
"very much, Mrs. Fisher."
"You"
"see the three heat sigs?"
"And the colder one on the floor?"
"That's Reece."
"So we got Dee Dee,"
"your mama, and our target."
"Which is a little too"
"eeny-meeny-miny-moe"
"for my taste."
"He's probably"
"the one on the right,"
"but I'm not sure."
"We got to get him to move."
"See if you can link"
"up with Reece again."
"Trigger his ANS."
"f*ck that, Burton."
"He'd be connecting to a corpse."
"Get the body to twitch,"
"and maybe the old man"
"will think Reece is still alive."
"He'll try to finish him off,"
"and then we can tag him."
"Bruh, are you hearing"
"me? Leon would feel it."
"Yeah. And Reece would do"
"the same thing for us,"
"if he was in our position."
"Why the f*ck are you two still"
"talking? Let's get this done."
"Flynne, tell us"
"when the target's clear."
"It's"
"him. He's moving."
"Execute."
"Mama?"
"Oh."
"Lights out."
"I need that old"
"man alive, Davis."
"There's some things"
"I want to do to him."
"Oh, I"
"understand, Corbell."
"We're gonna do everything"
"we can. You know that."
"She was a real wonderful woman,"
"Corbell. I can't imagine."
"Think I might've come up"
"with a pretty good one, Sheriff."
"Wanted to run it by you."
"Let's say the old man came here."
"Killed Mary."
"And Mr. Pickett there,"
"he called the police."
"You were first on"
"the scene, Sheriff."
"Because even after four terms,"
"you still take"
"your job seriously."
"And we all appreciate that."
"Tommy, what in the f*ck"
"do you think you're doing..."
"The old man was still here."
"Armed with this .45."
"And when you drew"
"your own weapon?"
"Well, he went and shot you."
"Multiple times, I'm afraid."
"All right, easy. You need"
"to calm down, Thomas."
"I'm already too calm, Sheriff."
"That's what's scaring me."
"It's like you said."
"Ain't got much of a"
"choice, now, do I?"
"Tommy, don't!"
"Well, f*ck me."
"I did not see that coming."
"Not by a mile."
"Now..."
"that calm you were"
"talking about?"
"I think you need"
"to lower your gun"
"until it comes back."
"So we can talk"
"this thing through."
"Come to an understanding here."
"You don't really think"
"that old man would've"
"let you live, now, do you?"
"What I don't think..."
"is that you have"
"the necessary balls"
"to pull this off on"
"your own, young man."
"Or the bullets."
"The f*ck's that supposed to be?"
"Oh, it's a doodad, you"
"arrogant piece of sh*t."
"You die,"
"it's for real."
"I die and I save my family."
"I want you to kill him."
"Wolf!"
"I'll tell you everything."
"Give you my word."
"Deputy. EMTs got a pulse."
"For who?"
"All we need are the secrets"
"inside the girl's head."
"No!"
"In our timeline"
"Flynne Fisher no longer exists."
"It's fairly"
"straightforward, gentlemen."
"We advance from floor to floor,"
"killing or disabling"
"everything we encounter."
"What's your biggest fear?"
"The past."
"If you try to double-cross me"
"again, I will carve you up."
"We got a situation on our hands."
"I need that old man alive."
"Technology that's been"
"stolen from you?"
"It can be a deadly weapon"
"in the wrong hands."
"Hey."
"I-I-I've been thinking."
"Yeah?"
"Lying here."
"About you and your sims."
"How you can go back, reboot."
"Wishing I could do it."
"Go back to that level"
"with the dog again."
"Shoot that bitch"
"this time."
"That's the thing about chess."
"Checkmate..."
"and you're f*cking done."
"That's what makes life so hard."
"No rebooting."
"Unit 204,"
"requesting immediate backup"
"to 27 Bateville Road."
"I got three parties down,"
"suspect at large,"
"presumed armed."
"I repeat: suspect at large"
"and presumed armed."
"Copy that, 204."
"10-52. Ambulance being"
"dispatched. Over."
"I really wouldn't worry"
"about it at this point."
"Do the best you can, maybe get"
"back to it in the morning."
"Deputy?"
"EMT's got a pulse."
"For who?"
"Dispatch, shots fired"
"at Clanton Urgent Med. 10-52..."
"10-52. Requesting backup."
"Mm-hmm."
"What is it?"
"Uh, shots fired."
"Clanton Urgent Med."
"It's got to be our perp."
"Reece is dead."
"I heard, on the ride over."
"They said that man"
"killed the sheriff, too."
"And the Picketts."
"Corbell's still hanging on."
"But he killed Sheriff Jackman?"
"Tommy?"
"Yeah, he did."
"Shot him dead."
"If Dr. Nuland has"
"her way,"
"your friend won't be the last."
"I assume you'd like to stop her."
"Yeah, of course."
"I'd like to propose an alliance."
"I have resources that"
"could prove quite empowering"
"to you in your world."
"And it appears you have"
"the capacity to act in mine"
"in ways that might be beyond me,"
"considering the factors"
"at play here,"
"which I've only"
"just become cognizant of."
"What do you mean?"
"You have much more than"
"Cherise Nuland to deal with,"
"as daunting as"
"the good doctor undoubtedly is."
"Your world is on a threshold"
"of its own Jackpot."
"I believe, in my own way,"
"I can help you navigate"
"the coming storm."
"If we're coming"
"towards an agreement,"
"now might be the ideal moment"
"for you to issue"
"any ultimatums"
"or demands you might have."
"My mama."
"She's blind again and sick."
"I need you to heal her,"
"like you promised you'd do at"
"the start of this whole thing."
"Ma'am?"
"She's consulting the Aunties."
"I'm very sorry."
"It appears"
"Mr. Zubov's technicals have"
"already attempted"
"everything possible."
"What, so you can't... help her?"
"I'm afraid not."
"The Aunties' best estimate is,"
"your mother has"
"another 554 hours to live."
"Approximately 23 days."
"I'll go talk to her."
"Please do."
"Flynne."
"They promised us, Burton."
"They promised us."
"I know you're sad,"
"Flynne, but..."
"I had a strange feeling"
"when I first found out"
"about the glioma,"
"concerning you."
"I was lying there"
"in that exam room,"
"just kind of"
"letting it wash over me."
"And I found myself thinking,"
"""Well, maybe it's not all bad."
"Maybe Flynne will really get"
"to live her life now."""
"I've been living my life exactly"
"as I want to, Mama, okay?"
"I wouldn't have chosen"
"any otherwise."
"I know, and don't think"
"I don't love you for it."
"You've been keeping us"
"all afloat for a long time now,"
"but you deserve more."
"I thought..."
"""Maybe they can sell the house,"
"if they want."
"There'll be some money there."""
"""Burton will go on being Burton,"
"for better for worse, but..."""
"""...who knows"
"what Flynne might get up to?"""
"And it made me sort of excited"
"to think on it."
"You having the chance"
"to become whatever you want."
"Where are you off to?"
"I think"
"your pills are kicking in, Mama."
"I was just gonna let you rest."
"Your father used to call you"
"our little acorn"
"when you were a baby."
"Why?"
"Because even though"
"you were just a tiny thing,"
"he could sense the power"
"and strength inside you,"
"waiting for its chance to grow."
"Just like a big old oak tree."
"I miss him, Mama."
"Me, too."
"Promise me, Flynne."
"You'll let that power grow."
"Maria Anathema Ash."
"Intriguing rÃ©sumÃ©."
"How on earth did you end up"
"in Lev Zubov's employ?"
"It's a complicated story,"
"and not particularly relevant"
"to what's prompted me to reach out to you."
"Which is?"
"The data Aelita West stole,"
"I know where it is"
"and how to get it."
"It's in Flynne Fisher's brain."
"Lev Zubov knows this,"
"so the Klept will soon have"
"everything Aelita stole."
"I don't want to live"
"in that world, Doctor."
"Okay, well, Inspector Lowbeer..."
"Clearly has her own agenda."
"I don't know what it is,"
"but you can't depend on her"
"to fix it."
"You have to stop him."
"Can you?"
"I can."
"But it will require"
"a drastic step."
"More drastic than"
"I had hoped would be necessary"
"and come at an unspeakable cost."
"How much time do I have?"
"Very little."
"I suppose"
"you'll be expecting a reward"
"for bearing me"
"these ill tidings?"
"I want you to kill him."
"Who?"
"Zubov."
"May I ask why?"
"A breach of etiquette."
"Well, it's not so easy,"
"what you ask,"
"given his Klept status."
"Unless..."
"...you'd be willing"
"to use your presence"
"in Mr. Zubov's household"
"to assist in the endeavor?"
"I would, with pleasure."
"Excellent."
"I'll be in touch."
"Your drastic step..."
"What is it?"
"I'm afraid I will be forced"
"to alter conditions"
"in the stub"
"in a manner that will destroy"
"or invalidate"
"decades' worth of studies,"
"vitally important research."
"But I will cut off a limb"
"to save the whole body."
"I don't understand."
"The Jackpot."
"I'll push it"
"to the next level,"
"thus removing the girl"
"from the equation altogether."
"Along with her home,"
"town, family,"
"the whole benighted region."
"Welcome back."
"How's your mother?"
"Dying."
"Which I guess you suspected"
"all along, huh?"
"I'm sorry, Flynne."
"I presented a possibility"
"as a certainty"
"to get you to do our bidding."
"It was wrong."
"You think"
"we can still find your sister?"
"She's dead."
"I can't see any way around it."
"Wilf."
"I'm sorry, Wilf."
"I keep feeling like"
"I'm missing something obvious,"
"that I'm just"
"too close to see it."
"Aelita told me I had a home"
"when I was young."
"She said"
"I used to talk about it."
"A lawn sloping down to a pond."
"But my first memories are"
"of the transit camp."
"The food queues."
"Rain falling on the blue tarp."
"A woman's face..."
"...who I've always chosen"
"to believe was my mother."
"Though it's likely"
"that's just fantasy."
"What about your father?"
"They took"
"all the men early on."
"I have no memories"
"of the raids on the camps,"
"but Aelita told me"
"how they burned us out."
"She took charge of me."
"I would have died without her."
"Where'd you go after that?"
"The streets, the ruins."
"For almost three years."
"And then?"
"I did something stupid."
"Wolf! Wolf!"
"We were captured."
"Cleaned up."
"Aelita fought"
"to keep us together."
"She always pined"
"for that life, though."
"""When we were free,"""
"she would say."
"So we ran off a few years"
"after we were adopted."
"Aelita planned it."
"Squirreled away supplies,"
"mapped our route back."
"We lasted for eight months or so"
"in our own little kingdom."
"We even made a flag for it."
"The hand missing a thumb."
"Why?"
"Aelita used to say we'd"
"all lived in a paradise once."
"Before we evolved"
"into what we are."
"Hmm."
"She claimed"
"every sin of ours originated"
"with the opposable thumb."
"The ability to grip..."
"...tools, weapons, throats."
"What happened"
"after the eight months?"
"I fell sick."
"I would have died."
"Aelita brought me back in."
"She gave up everything,"
"once again, to save me."
"She really loved you, Wilf."
"Inspector Lowbeer's asked me"
"to have a word..."
"...about her proposal."
"But I'm afraid I'm not"
"quite certain what to say,"
"because one must always assume"
"she can hear us,"
"should she choose."
"Is there something"
"you want to tell me?"
"You feel like you can't?"
"I wouldn't put it"
"quite that pointedly."
"It's more of a shading"
"than a specific thing."
"Well,"
"why don't we link up again?"
"Why?"
"I can ask you questions."
"You don't have to say anything."
"I can just, I don't know,"
"draw my own conclusions"
"by the way that you feel."
"How do you feel about Lowbeer?"
"I'd like to propose"
"an alliance."
"Lev?"
"You will never be"
"fully yourself"
"until you embrace"
"that part of your soul."
"Aelita?"
"The individual"
"you know, his overture..."
"or whatever you want"
"to call it..."
"it's gonna make me happy,"
"is it?"
"Flynne Fisher?"
"Wilf Netherton?"
"You're all rainbows"
"and unicorns, Ms. Fisher."
"Wait."
"Where was it?"
"What?"
"The hand with no thumb,"
"your secret place."
"Christ."
"I'm such a fool."
"Should we call Zubov?"
"No."
"We serve a new master now."
"You sure this is where it is?"
"But it wasn't like this."
"It was forest,"
"trees as far as you can see."
"Wilf."
"What took you so long, Wolf?"
"No more games, Aelita."
"Where are you?"
"Follow me."
"But not her."
"No, she's the heart of this."
"She's coming."
"Eyes and ears, Wolf."
"She shares hers with others."
"Isn't that right, Ash?"
"She can leave of her own accord,"
"or I can send her myself."
"Your choice."
"But..."
"Go home."
"I'll tell you everything."
"I give you my word."
"Look familiar?"
"This is where the camp was,"
"where we first met."
"You don't remember, do you?"
"I was too young."
"You were seven, Wolf."
"It was too young"
"for many things,"
"but remembering isn't"
"one of them."
"The reason you don't remember is"
"'cause you're not supposed to."
"Aelita."
"Our implants, turns out"
"they're rather complex devices."
"And one thing that they do"
"do best is suppress memory."
"Everyone knows that."
"They blunt trauma."
"Well, do you want to know what"
"happened when I ripped out mine?"
"You lost your immunity boost,"
"among other things,"
"which I suspect"
"you'll soon come to regret."
"No, I started"
"to remember things."
"Everything."
"There's bodies here,"
"under this beautiful green turf,"
"thousands and thousands"
"of bodies."
"Dig a hole, love."
"Your mother's here,"
"and your sisters"
"and your little brother."
"And you'd remember them"
"if you'd just cut yourself free."
"My family, too."
"All slaughtered."
"Give it to him."
"Are you just gonna stand there"
"with your hands in your pockets?"
"f*cking pick it up."
"Do you want to know"
"who killed our families, Wolf?"
"The Klept."
"Your mate Lev's father"
"and his sort,"
"'cause they were"
"running things by then."
"There was contagion"
"in the camps,"
"and they wiped us all out"
"for fear of it."
"And not just here,"
"all over England."
"It was"
"a little coordinated effort."
"Five million people"
"in under a fortnight."
"Now, that's quite"
"an achievement, isn't it?"
"Don't you think?"
"So, yeah,"
"they suppress our memories"
"because they still fear us."
"Us?"
"I'm gathering them."
"A little army"
"of the dispossessed."
"You know, render justice."
"What could you possibly plan"
"to accomplish with this rabble?"
"Shatter a few windows?"
"I'm sure the Klept"
"and the R.I. will be terrified."
"All we need are the proper tools."
"Which are?"
"The secrets to every wonder"
"that the R.I. have ever built."
"Infinity"
"in the palm of your hand."
"And where would you possibly"
"get that?"
"Inside the girl's head."
"That doctor give you"
"a probability or anything,"
"Jasper? You know, like,"
"ten percent chance of survival,"
"something like that?"
"He just said I should"
"prepare for the worst."
"Well, I'm real sorry"
"for your loss."
"You know, we all are."
"But, uh, he died"
"like a warrior king, didn't he?"
"He's not dead yet."
"You know what I mean."
"He went out fighting."
"And we owe it to him"
"to carry on his legacy."
"So, uh, guess"
"I'm next in charge, right?"
"How you figure?"
"Well, I was always"
"his number two."
"The f*ck you were."
"All right, all right."
"Let's say"
"we approach this thing like a..."
"uh, what do you call it?"
"That thing that the Romans did"
"when, uh,"
"there were three emperors?"
"f*ck, what was it?"
"Uh, a, uh..."
"A triumvirate."
"Yeah, that's it."
"Yeah, but there's four of us."
"Aw."
"You can still drive for us,"
"Jasper."
"Wash our cars and sh*t."
"Oh, absolutely, you-you do"
"a great job with them cars."
"Now..."
"Let's get a fresh one of these."
"Go on."
"â™ª I need your help..."
"Oh, and, um..."
"put it on your uncle's tab,"
"if they're still honoring it."
"â™ª You're the only one"
"who can save my soul â™ª"
"â™ª Save my soul â™ª â™ª"
"Open"
"the f*cking window."
"What?"
"Open the f*ck..."
"You're gonna have to"
"clean that up now, Jasper."
"Who should I drop off first?"
"Jasper?"
"You remember that fight"
"we had about Monopoly?"
"What time is it?"
"It's a little after 2:00."
"We were playing Flynne and"
"Burton and Ella on Thanksgiving."
"And, uh, I was way ahead,"
"and I was sort of"
"feeling bad about it,"
"so I kept letting people"
"borrow money"
"when it seemed like"
"they were about to go bust."
"And then,"
"in the end, Burton came back"
"from nothing to win."
"Hon, are you drunk?"
"You got mad at me after."
"You said..."
"I'd never amount to anything"
"if I didn't stop mistaking"
"weakness for kindness."
"Oh, Jasper."
"I-I didn't mean that."
"Yes, you did."
"No. No. I really didn't."
"The whole reason I married you"
"is 'cause of how kind you are."
"Why'd you say that, then?"
"I guess I just wanted"
"you to win for once."
"I felt like you deserved it."
"Why are we having"
"this conversation?"
"I was about to make"
"a huge f*cking mistake."
"How do you mean?"
"Nothing. I love you."
"I'll be home soon."
"Atticus!"
"f*ck! Atticus!"
"Atticus, wake up, man!"
"Atticus!"
"f*cking wake the f*ck up."
"Atticus! Atticus!"
"Cash, Cash, Cash, Cash!"
"Atticus!"
"Hey."
"Atticus! Atticus!"
"Atticus, wake up!"
"Wake the f*ck up."
"Atticus!"
"What the f*ck?"
"Oh, f*ck."
"I heard about"
"that train crash, Tommy."
"That's not why I'm here."
"Look, I know you've been"
"keeping secrets,"
"Flynne."
"Tommy."
"Ain't no need to give me a line."
"I get it."
"I got a, uh, phone call"
"from Homeland Security."
"Right-wing militia chatter."
"Serious enough for Homes"
"to sound the alarm."
"Given all the weird things"
"that've been swirling around"
"you and Burton,"
"I need to know"
"if you know anything about it."
"What is it?"
"They say they're planning"
"to blow up a missile silo."
"And, you know, there's"
"that new, uh, Air Force silo"
"down towards Spring Creek,"
"the big one."
"Flynne, if you know"
"anything about this..."
"I don't."
"I got to go, Tommy."
"Macon..."
"get the headset ready."
"I got to go back."
"Ash, Ash."
"Where's Wilf?"
"Why are you back?"
"That silo explosion,"
"the one we saw"
"in the Jackpot museum."
"Cherise is trying to"
"make it happen in my timeline."
"I'm sure of it."
"You already knew?"
"What the f*ck"
"have you done, Ash?"
"The data you and Aelita"
"stole from the R.I.,"
"it's stored in DNA."
"It's the sh*t in my head,"
"isn't it?"
"The reason I've been having"
"these f*cking seizures."
"What is it?"
"The entire library, I suspect."
"Enough to wreak havoc"
"in your world and mine."
"And now Lev knows about it."
"You have to understand,"
"if the Klept got hold of it..."
"I told Cherise Nuland."
"I had to."
"And now she's gonna vaporize"
"my entire f*cking state"
"just to make sure"
"that Lev doesn't"
"get his hands on the data."
"My life, my family."
"Everyone that I love."
"It's just a f*cking game to you,"
"isn't it?"
"Winner takes all."
"Where are you going?"
"I'm gonna win."
"This is"
"the real London."
"At least the part"
"they haven't rebuilt yet."
"They got their work"
"cut out for 'em, don't they?"
"Why are we here?"
"So we can talk"
"without being overheard."
"Cherise Nuland,"
"she's planning on blowing up"
"that silo over in Spring Creek."
"Wiping all of us out,"
"just to make sure that I'm dead."
"So I came up with an idea"
"to open up a new stub."
"You saying what I think you are?"
"You want to reboot?"
"Like in a sim?"
"It could save us, Conner."
"But I'm gonna need your help"
"and Lowbeer's, too."
"It's a black hole."
"In a sim,"
"you can get to a level"
"where no matter what you do"
"you end up dying,"
"over and over,"
"'cause you made some mistake"
"earlier in the game"
"without even realizing it."
"You're trapped."
"I'm sorry, my dear."
"I wish it hadn't come to this."
"When we first met, I asked you"
"if you had the power"
"to sever the connection"
"to my stub."
"Do you?"
"No."
"What about opening a new one?"
"I'm afraid the delicate balance"
"of power that governs this world"
"would make"
"such a step on my part"
"an outright declaration of war."
"But I am aware of"
"how one might do it."
"I need you to open a new stub."
"If I understand this correctly,"
"you're proposing"
"a rather radical plan."
"Cherise will think she won"
"and that you helped her do it."
"We'd have access to"
"all the data that Aelita stole,"
"which would save my world"
"from the Jackpot."
"You do realize"
"how daunting the odds are?"
"Perhaps an ally"
"might benefit you."
"Your brother, for instance."
"Burton can't know."
"If he finds out,"
"he's never gonna let me"
"go through with it, okay?"
"Conner said that he'd help."
"Are you absolutely certain?"
"Yeah."
"The R.I. has several ancillary"
"sites at undisclosed locations."
"Stub portals, they're called."
"Even the guards don't know"
"where they are."
"They're Peripherals,"
"piloted remotely."
"The Peripherals guarding"
"the facility will be"
"just as strong as you are."
"Send me to one."
"I've arrived."
"May I be of assistance?"
"Maybe."
"Can I ask you a question?"
"Is it still queasy"
"when you get back?"
"Or did they fix that?"
"When you wake up"
"in your real body,"
"after your shift"
"in this Peripheral's done?"
"Damn it."
"You really think"
"you could escape me so easily?"
"You have a bad habit"
"of taking control"
"of dying things, Cherise."
"You have no idea"
"all you're putting into peril."
"They're all here,"
"aren't they?"
"All these other lives?"
"And all I got to do is"
"choose where I want to begin."
"Wait."
"I will find you."
"I give you my word."
"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure,"
"Cherise."
"I think I want to be"
"the hunter now."
"You see,"
"I know exactly where you are."
"And you have no idea"
"where I'm gonna be."
"Not without the coordinates."
"No, no, no."
"You saying"
"what I think you are?"
"You want to reboot."
"Like in a sim?"
"It could save us, Conner."
"But I'm gonna need your help"
"and Lowbeer's, too."
"If I can pull it off,"
"there'll be"
"whole new versions of us there."
"Ones that Cherise"
"will have nothing to do with."
"We'd be safe there."
"But dead in our own world."
"Unless I'm already gone."
"Then she'd have no reason"
"to blow up that silo."
"f*ck."
"Burton said in Texas"
"you once shot somebody"
"two kilometers out."
"Burton's full of sh*t."
"It was at least three klicks."
"This thing"
"that I'm talking about..."
"...it'd have to look"
"like Lowbeer sent somebody"
"as a favor to Cherise,"
"solving her problem for her."
"You understand"
"what I'm asking you, Conner?"
"Yeah."
"I get it."
"What about this world?"
"We done with it?"
"No, we'll be back."
"Why?"
"'Cause I'm gonna"
"kill that bitch."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah."
"I know it's a lot, Conner."
"But if it helps any,"
"I've made peace with it."
"I'll just take a walk"
"out past Hawthorne Creek."
"And I'll count back"
"from ten in my head."
"Ten."
"Nine."
"Eight."
"Seven."
"Six."
"Five."
"Four."
"Three."
"Two."
"So..."
"shall we get to work?"
"Yeah,"
"you promise every time,"
"but you end up"
"spending the whole meal"
"talking with your father,"
"while I'm trapped"
"with your mother."
"My mother enjoys"
"your company, Dominika."
"Which is lovely and"
"extremely flattering, I'm sure."
"But as you're well aware,"
"the sentiment"
"isn't entirely reciprocated."
"So if you could just"
"spare me a moment of your..."
"Oh, Lev. What have you done?"
"Nothing. I swear."
"I love you."
"I'm sorry, gentlemen, there seems to be some..."
"Have a seat."
"I was supposed to meet"
"my father..."
"Your father sends his regrets."
"Wasn't feeling well."
"Not in the best of health."
"You understand."
"As such,"
"he asked us to speak with you."
"About what?"
"Accepted practices"
"here in London"
"since the Putin diaspora."
"Mm, how we get along, survive."
"Did I do something wrong?"
"The Research Institute,"
"placing us at risk."
"It's unacceptable."
"Absolutely."
"There's a price, son."
"Listen, gentlemen."
"My recruitment of an asset"
"inside the Research Institute"
"was nothing outside of the norm."
"I was trying to exploit"
"an opportunity."
"But I deeply regret"
"if I did anything"
"that you feel could"
"jeopardize our standing."
"I assure you"
"that was never my intent."
"I, uh, sincerely apologize"
"and can only hope"
"that you forgive me."
"Should see your f*cking face!"
"We get it."
"It is always in our interest"
"to keep tabs on the R.I."
"Not only for"
"moneymaking opportunities"
"but to protect"
"our own interests."
"Business, otherwise."
"None of that matters now."
"Time to cut bait."
"Do whatever you have to do."
"Just cauterize"
"the wound."
"Your asset, any affiliates"
"come back to you,"
"they need to vanish."
"All of them?"
"When there's a blight"
"on the branch"
"and it threatens"
"the other trees,"
"what does the orchard keeper do?"
"Chops the f*cker down."
"Burns it."
"Not just the branch"
"either."
"The whole f*cking tree."
"Your wife looked lovely, Lev."
"And the children?"
"This here is us warning you."
"You understand?"
"Cauterize the wound, son."
"Or the orchard keeper"
"will be coming for a visit."
"With an axe."
"You hungry?"
"Hmm? Where's that"
"f*cking waiter?"
"Salud."
