This is a cleaned and reformatted version of transcriptions of the dialogue from the Amazon TV series [The Peripheral](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8291284/).

The transcripts were originally sourced [from this link](https://subslikescript.com/series/The_Peripheral-8291284) at the site SubsLikeScript.

The data in the `raw` folder are the original text with blank lines removed and expletives censored.  

The `processed` folder contains three files:
- `all.csv` - all dialogue, unshuffled and concatenated from the raw files
- `train.csv` - a 70% sample of the combined files, lines shuffled
- `test.csv` - a 30% sample of the combined files, lines shuffled

Both files contain a single column, `text`, and are suitable for generative text tasks.
